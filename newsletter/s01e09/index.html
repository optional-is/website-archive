					<h2>üå≥üå≥üå≥ Dating Hedge Rows üå≥üå≥üå≥</h2>
					<p>In the last episode, <a href="../s01e08/index.html">s01e08</a>, we learnt about the "Miyawaki method" and how Japanese shrines are preserved plant ecosystems.<br />
<br />
It turns out hedges have some magical properties too. "Hooper's rule", named for Dr. Max Hooper, suggests that the age of a hedge can be estimated by counting the number of woody species in a thirty-yard distance and multiplying it by 110 years*.<br />
<br />
<small>* The formula also does not work on hedges more than a thousand years old.</small></p>

					<h3>‚Åä "Tironian sign et" is the word for "and"</h3>
					<p>Tironian notes are a set of thousands of signs that were formerly used in a system of shorthand dating from the 1st century BCE and named after the inventor, Tiro, a personal secretary to Marcus Tullius Cicero.<br />
<br />
A few symbols are still in use today, specifically ‚Åä  to mean "and".<br />
<br />
The numeral 7 is also used as a substitute in informal contexts.<br />
<br />
Could this be why, 2,000 years later, & and 7 are on the same key?</p>

					<h3>Cemani means "thoroughly black" (down to the bones)</h3>
					<p>üêì The Ayam Cemani is a rare breed of chicken from Indonesia. Their beaks, tongues, combs and wattles appear black, and even their meat, bones, and organs are black or gray. Their blood is normally colored.</p>

					<h3>Max Headroom Signal Hijacking</h3>
					<p>One evening in November 01987, an unknown person wearing a Max Headroom costume twice took over the terrestrial broadcasts outside of Chicago, Illinois. The 90-second-long stunts were investigated, but no one was convicted. The statute of limitations has passed and no one has stepped forward to shed light on the mystery.</p>
