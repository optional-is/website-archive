<p>Several years ago I was introduced to some randomly spicy peppers called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shishito">Shishito</a>. This was probably in Lisbon, Portugal were these are common as an appetiser. Since then I&#8217;ve been looking to attempt to grow my own peppers since they are impossible to find in the shops in Iceland. Back in mid-May I got my chance. A pack of Shishito pepper seeds were sent to me. They were promptly planted and within a few weeks sprouted. It&#8217;s now 5 months later and we have healthy looking peppers just about ready to pick and eat.</p>

<p>The obsession with these peppers is the mystery of whether or not any pepper you bite into will be spicy. They are randomly spicy, so only 1 in 10 have a kick. There are no distinguishing features which leads you to believe them to be spicy or not. It is nature&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_roulette">Russian roulette</a>.</p>

<p>These peppers are an excellent stand-in for much of the work we do around random sampling. VÃ­sar&#8217;s whole business model revolves around taking a statical random sample which represents the whole school community. People are always skeptical about random sampling, but these peppers are a tasteful example of how you only need to taste a few to know that something isn&#8217;t right. Rather than being forced to eat every single one to determine some outcome, a random sample will do the trick.</p>

<p>These plants are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_plant">annuals</a>, which means that at they won&#8217;t flower again next year. That means that some of our peppers currently being grown will have to donate their seeds for next year&#8217;s batch. It is great fun to have some greenery growing in the office, especially such a uniquely random plant. We had considered harvesting some of the seeds and giving them away as part of the <a href="../../../../../contest.1">quarterly contest</a> next year, but due to every country&#8217;s various flora and fauna import restrictions it makes things complicated. You can always order some seeds from a local source, they cost only a few dollars and then you can start your own pepper patch. If you are in Reykjavik and want some seeds or a plant, just let us know. We&#8217;re happy to donate a few while they last.</p>
