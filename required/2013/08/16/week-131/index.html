				<p>131 is a palindrome, it can be read the same forwards as backwards. We&#8217;re big into palindromes here, so much so that we always try to schedule our posting at a palindromic time; 12:21, 13:31, 14:41, 15:51. Sometimes it doesn&#8217;t work, but we do our best.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/131_(number)">131 is also an interesting mathematical number</a>, but I&#8217;ll spare you the exact details.</p>
<p>Summer seems to have come and gone here in Reykjavik, Iceland. The week has been overcast and cloudy.</p>
<p>It is friday, which means it is also <a href="https://twitter.com/baconfriday">@baconfriday</a>. This is a project we&#8217;ve been part of for over five years now, posting a single bacon link every friday. There is an endless supply of interesting bacon related web pages and projects.</p>
<p>This week has seen ongoing development for Vísar&#8217;s reporting and analytics software. We&#8217;ve sent out 2 or 3 proposals and been given a few opportunities to write some articles for magazines. There was a UIE dress rehearsal on Thursday prepping for next weeks online seminar <a href="http://www.uie.com/events/virtual_seminars/hands_on_data_viz/">Data Visualizations that Pack a Punch</a>, and we had a photographer in on Friday to take some photos of the office for an upcoming magazine feature article.</p>
<p>Project Helgafell had some movement forward. As a proof-of-concept and as a way to ditch having to build an admin while the tool is evolving, we&#8217;ve implemented everything to run from an excel spreadsheet. While not ideal, it has advantages. People know how to work spreadsheets and it creates a clear line of where our work starts and their work ends. If this project goes well, this will eventually fade away, but for now that&#8217;s the way it&#8217;s going to have to be. From a programming perspective, reading and writing spreadsheets is trivial, but for non-technical folks it might as well be magic.</p>
<p>There has also been some movement and plans for two other side-projects. One inspired by <a href="http://candychang.com">Candy Chang</a>&#8216;s work and some of our staff&#8217;s real-life experiences around renting in Iceland. We&#8217;ll see where that develops and if it is useful for us, it will probably be useful for others too. The other project is also paper-based which we&#8217;re aiming for an October 1st launch, not much more to say right now about that one.</p>

<p>We have a bread maker here in the office. The dream was to arrive to work with a beautiful, fresh loaf of bread waiting for us. So far we didn&#8217;t have great success with the first 2-3 loaves. We chalked that up to doing everything by eye. So the most recent loaf we followed the instructions. It came out worse that the others, so we&#8217;re back to our system.</p>

<p>One of the hobbies we love here at the office is kite flying, specifically <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/kiteaerialphotography/">KAP (Kite Aerial Photography)</a>. A link to this beautiful kite design crossed our paths this week. It is an amazing <a href="http://www.hapticlab.com/collections/kites/products/shipkite">kite made to look like an old tall ship</a>.</p>

<p>On August 16th, 1977 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley">Elvis Presley</a> past away. We&#8217;re remembering him today with Peanut Butter Banana Sandwiches in the office.</p>
