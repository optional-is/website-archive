				<p>It is week #132. The number 132 is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_number">self-number</a>, which means it is the sum of integers with the values 1, 2 and 3. It is also the number of columns of a Line printer printing in landscape mode on 14-inch paper. In the year 132, the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seismometer">Seismometer</a> was invent to measure earthquakes.</p>
<p>Another busy week here at HQ. A few projects moving forward and a few more started.</p>
<p>Helgafell prototype was delivered to the folks in Australia on time for some of their presentations. If things go well, this will continue to grow as a potential product.</p>
<p>We started exploring a new side-project based on similar work from <a href="http://candychang.com">Candy Chang</a>, but for Iceland. The first and biggest snag was we&#8217;re not sure the copyright of Icelandic Laws. (No one can quite give us a straight answer) Which means the whole thing might get scuttled, but we&#8217;re moving forward and intend to get support from the right ministries.</p>
<p>Another potential project has started to get explored using <a href="http://dbpedia.org">DBPedia</a> data and SPARQL to search it. This will be a nice demonstration as a bridge project from a digital, global database into a dynamically generated posted suitable for framing. We&#8217;re confident with the digital portion, after spending the summer deep in the trenches with SVG. Now it is the analog portion we&#8217;ll fight with.</p>
<p>Vísar has also been moving forward. Lots of little clean-up projects and archiving before the start of the school year for next month.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also submitted an article to a local magazine regarding Dashboard and Business Metrics. When that is published, we can share more.</p>
<p>A draft copy of our .NET spread has come through and it looks great. Can&#8217;t wait for that to get printed soon.</p>
<p>Finally, the UIE online seminar was a big hit. People had some really smart questions and good feedback.</p>
<h2>Bric-à-brac</h2>
<p>I love things that are proxies for something else. Stories about more dogs and cats going missing as a lead indicator for earthquakes or satellite photos of cars in big box store&#8217;s parking lots as a proxy quarterly earnings. The more reason one is the <a href="http://www.ediblegeography.com/the-pickle-index/">Pickle Index</a>. Based on the sales of pickled goods in the country-side of China as a proxy for population left after an emptying into the city.</p>

<p>One of the projects mentioned in the UIE talk was the concept of 3D printed data visualizations. There are plenty out there now, but the newest was a few weeks ago at Wimbledon. <a href="http://wimbledoninsights.com">The 3D printed small trophies based on in game stats</a>. Each player had a unique trophy based on their play.</p>
