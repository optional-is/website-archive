<p>Over the course of 02022, each day we&#8217;d look at a few news websites and grab a few interesting headlines and paste them into a text file. These headlines are completely biased to both personal tastes, presumed historic value and news corporations publication interest. That&#8217;s not to say there aren&#8217;t some interesting entries and value in seeing things in context with each other.</p>



<p>This is the complete list of &#8220;This Year I Learnt&#8221; headlines from various news sources and some hashtags we added. Some of the events listed might have happened the day before the news broke or due to timezone, some events might have occurred in the future in relation to the local news website&#8217;s geographic location.</p>



<p>These are (mostly) direct copies of the headlines from the website. We didn&#8217;t write them, but instead used them verbatim to make it easier to copy and paste into any search engine and find them. There are also different spellings for various people and places &#8211; that&#8217;s not out typo, that&#8217;s different news organization style guides. After a year&#8217;s worth of headlines, we should have also saved the original link for the citation. &#x1f937;&#x1f3fb;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;</p>



<p><a href="index.html#headline-stats" data-type="internal" data-id="#headline-stats">At the end of the list, we&#8217;ve complied a stats list with a general overview</a>.</p>

<p>Much like what we choose to save, these hashtags are also arbitrary. We could have easily add one for #Russia, #Trump, #gun-violence or #protests as well as adding more hashtags to headlines. For instance, LGBT headlines could potentially be added into #gun-violence, #politics, #LGBT and more. There are only a few headlines about Africa or even South America, but we&#8217;re positive there is news worthy of documenting there too.</p>



<p>This is the first time we&#8217;ve saved and published anything like this. Only after compiling this list, we realized we should have saved the original link for a citation. We&#8217;re also focused on English news websites (partly because that&#8217;s what we can read, but also our sphere of influence), trying to diversify to additional news sources is another improvement. &#8220;Peacocking&#8221; (where we choose certain news over others to make ourselves look more &#8220;interesting&#8221; or &#8220;self-important&#8221; than we really are) is also something to be aware of. Not choosing to save a headline because we (or we assume) or our audience wouldn&#8217;t know what it was or wouldn&#8217;t find it of interest is another potential pitfall. </p>



<p>Saving headlines daily, while both keeping in mind trends and sudden random events, is all about being as un-biased as possible, but also keeping focus, curating, and making things interesting.</p>



<p>The websites we saved our links most from were the <a href="https://www.bbc.com">BBC</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/international">Guardian</a>, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com">CNN</a> and various links from social media. None of which are (currently) behind a pay-wall. That makes it more open for anyone to read, but isn&#8217;t directly supporting journalism either.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re open for feedback from this long list and adjust for 02023. We&#8217;ve found it interesting to read back over the news and see what our past-selves thought was interesting.</p>
