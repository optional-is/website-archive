<p>This is week #492, it is the  sum of six consecutive primes (71 + 73 + 79 + 83 + 89 + 97). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_with_the_most_skyscrapers">There are also over 1950 skyscrapers over 492ft tall</a>.</p>



<p>This is our last week before an extended summer holiday. Little things will get done over the next few weeks, but it we won&#8217;t have any weeknotes in the meantime.  We&#8217;ll be back to (semi-) regular broadcasts in September.</p>



<p>This week turned out to be pretty interesting. We have two new project leads; one down in Australia doing some charts for business intelligence and another potential dashboard project.</p>



<p>The project in Australia is dealing with a company&#8217;s cashflow in and out on big construction projects. Giving them a weekly overview of the discrepancies will help them gain an overview of their profitability and float. We will start with a simple prototype to make sure we can connect to all their internal payroll and project systems, then if they are happy continue to build-out something more detailed.</p>



<p>The dashboard project is only an introduction email. In the next few weeks we&#8217;ll have some meeting to discuss how we can help. That could be as simple as consulting on a few software recommendations, or maybe some paper mock-ups that a designer would take further. Maybe they have an internal development team and maybe they don&#8217;t?</p>



<p>We also spent some time this week pair programming to get more data flowing into a centralised system to help link it all together. In doing so, we learnt a new term, ROAS, Return On Ad Spend. There is that famous quote, &#8220;Half my advertising is wasted, I just don&#8217;t know which half.&#8221; In the digital world, it is &#8216;easier&#8217; to attribute the cost to acquire a new customer and how much they in turn spend. Which is the return on the cost to acquire them. If that&#8217;s below 1, then you&#8217;ll be losing money and need to change your strategy.</p>



<p>Finally, our top secrete project continues to mature and we continue to polish all the corners. The goal is to soon get a few more alpha testers in and we harden it before turning it over to people outside our direct circle  of friends.</p>



<h2>Bric-Ã -brac</h2>



<p>As part of <a href="https://analog.is">analog.is</a> we designed a potential notebook fo Olympus Mons mountain on Mars. It is 2.5 times taller than Mt. Everest. If you were to walk up its gentle slope, you&#8217;d be walking into space. It is also so tall, that the planet&#8217;s curvature affects your ability to see the peak from the base and the base from the peak.  </p>



<p>But, we learnt this week about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheasilvia">Rheasilvia</a>, the tallest peak in our solar system and it is on an asteroid. It is only slightly taller than Olympus Mons. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_mountains_in_the_Solar_System">You can compare all the different heights of peaks in our solar system on Wikipedia.</a></p>

<p>We have been experimenting with an old idea to do some image style transfers. After some experimentation, we&#8217;ve realised that we probably can&#8217;t do what we wanted, but at the same time opened our eyes to something new. That&#8217;s a whole post in itself.</p>
