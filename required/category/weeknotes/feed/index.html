					<description><![CDATA[A double weeknote as we ramp-up after the summer break.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #707</h2>



<p>As one project wanes another waxes. The amount of time we&#8217;ve been spending on the Miami project has decreased. They&#8217;re in good shape; onboarding customers and prepping for raising a round of investment. The features, bugs and tasks are at a minimum as they want to be stable and get customer feedback. Which means we have more time for some VR projects. The video team has handed over the rough spatial videos and we&#8217;ve been putting them into an app for review. Then our client has the opportunity to look at the footage in an Apple Vision Pro and approve which clips they want to clean-up further. (By cleaning-up this means removing any tripods, drone rotors, color grading, blending two different shots for indoor and outdoor lighting, etc.)</p>



<p>A very old, pre-COVID project is coming out of mothballs. We worked on a health survey starting back in 02018 (or maybe even earlier?). It was making use of Iceland&#8217;s single-sign-on service. Now that is closed, they are working with another company on au√∞kenni login. We got dragged along to help get that working with the health survey. We&#8217;re recommending to use the other company and remove us from the development loop altogether. We are happy to continue to consult on data and visualizations, but we don&#8217;t have the time for new development or maintenance.</p>



<p>With the end of the Single Sign-on Service (island.is), our other survey tools have moved to TOTP (time-based One-Time Passwords). These are the additional 6 digits you enter from your authenticator app when you login. We rolled this out at the start of the summer and have our customers several months to migrate over before we made it mandatory. We&#8217;ve also been taking things in steps. At the start of the summer you could always login without 2FA, but you would not see any results until you enabled it. Next week, we&#8217;ll turn this on for everyone who needs manage surveys, not just see results. At this point, all sensitive data will be behind 2FA.</p>



<p>Our mastodon instance is back up and running. You can follow some of the team here: <a href="https://lodfill.is/@briansuda">https://lodfill.is/@briansuda</a></p>



<p>We&#8217;re waiting for an NDA for a big new project, or we think it&#8217;s big, they can&#8217;t tell us much until we sign, and after we do, we can&#8217;t talk about it. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f937-1f3fb-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>We&#8217;re also waiting for another big contract to be signed before we potentially get pulled into more work. This is via another team that we&#8217;ve done some analytics stuff in the past with, but this new project might not need a lot of data work, but we&#8217;re on call if needed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #708</h2>



<p>Monday started with a <a href="https://petals.team">PETALS</a> sync. There are two upcoming events where PETALS is being discussed, so today we went over loose-ends, the staging server and tasks for the next 3 weeks. </p>



<p>Monday is also Labor Day in the USA, so it is quiet &#8211; no meetings, no project movement.</p>



<p>Our Student Surveys also started today, Monday September 1st. They run for 9 months, so this is our longest running survey. We do update the survey with big fixes through out the year, but we do our best to free development as to not break anything or make any big changes mid-survey. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f389.png" alt="üéâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hex-maze-1024x767.png" alt="Hex Maze" />
<figcaption>Dynamically generated maze using a grid of hexagons.</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>We continue to explore more generative mazes for our <a href="https://adventure-mazes.com">Adventure Mazes Books</a>. This time we tried to generate mazes using hexagons instead of squares. In a normal square gird maze, from any spot you have 4 potential directions the maze could branch, but with hexagons, you have 6 ways it could branch. You&#8217;d think this additional paths would create for a harder maze, but given you don&#8217;t want to be able to loop back into the main path to the exit, we feel it makes things easier to solve? Some testing will help.</p>



<p>Miami is back to the forefront getting invoicing and rates included into the backend logic. Each customer can set various contracts in place with their clients. When the job is done, we created a scheduled task to roll-up on an hourly, weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis all the jobs and the total costs to create an invoice.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re getting back some sample Spatial Videos to preview in the VR headsets. We&#8217;re getting that workflow in place for client review. The way you shoot and compose videos and stories for an immersive experience is completely different than you do for a flat screen. It&#8217;s been a great learning experience.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re STILL waiting for an NDA for a big new project, or we think it&#8217;s big, they can&#8217;t tell us much until we sign, and after we do, we can&#8217;t talk about it. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f937-1f3fb-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

					<description><![CDATA[A triple weekenote where we get back into the office and are getting caught-up with projects. Usually summer is slow, but this year it has been non-stop!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #704</h2>



<p>Monday was a public holiday in Iceland, it was Commerce Day&nbsp;or Verslumannahelgi. It is a big travel weekend and bookends the summer holidays.</p>



<p>Wednesday we got back to the Reykjavik Office and are slowly getting things back in order.</p>



<p>We got caught-up on <a href="https://adventure-mazes.com">Adventure Mazes</a> publishing tasks. We&#8217;ve been updating the PDFs slightly and tweaked the logo. There is a digital download if you want to print it yourself. The website is mostly made-up of horizontal block banners. We kept it simple so it also works on mobile. Since each block works more-or-less independently, we also have a tiny PHP if statement to rearrange them based on the date. That means as Halloween approaches, that block is at the top. In November the Christmas mazes are featured. As we add more books, we can continue to dynamically re-order topics based on the time of year.</p>



<p>We use Heroku for most projects. It is easy to work with and simple to turn over to a customer without them needing a dedicated IT team to manage it all. As part of that process, Heroku is pretty good about keeping minor versions of software up-to-date, but every once and awhile we need to go in and manually back-up and update bigger version jumps for the database, python or the Heroku stack. We took advantage of the slow summer days and made some improvements.</p>



<p>On Friday, we had a <a href="https://petals.team">PETALS</a> sync meeting. After the long summer, we&#8217;re getting back on track by reviewing tasks, updating the priorities and generally getting back into a rhythm.</p>



<p>The Miami Project continues to move forward. We started to connect Stripe so that in the future we can collect payments. It is still too early to figure out pricing, but we&#8217;ve built it into the app and the backend so it is ready to turn on at any time. The other important thing that needed to be built to make this happen is to make sure the app won&#8217;t work unless the customer upgrades. Otherwise, you can roll-out a payment scheme, but if a customer doesn&#8217;t update, they never see the payment button! Otherwise, most of our tasks are not Quality-of-Life type of improvements: Better mobile views on the website, more SMS and push notifications, referral program and other small things.</p>



<p>The VR Project is now back to the front of the queue. We&#8217;ve taken the SwiftUI code for the Vision Pro and ported it over to the iPad. Most everything works fine, but we need to change some colors; the Vision Pro is a default dark/glass theme and the iPad is white. The other team making content is finished and next week we&#8217;ll start to get raw images and video we can plug into flush out the UI a bit more.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #705</h2>



<p>This week we learnt about <a href="https://www.designswarm.com/papercamp-3/">PaperCamp 3</a>! It is a little over a month away in London and we&#8217;re seriously contemplating going. 10+ years ago, we were invited to PaperCamp 1 (or 2) and missed it and have forever regretted it. That saw the seeds of &#8220;Little Printer&#8221; be born &#8211; which we still think is a great idea!</p>



<p>On Wednesday we had a meeting about the depreciation of the Island.is SSO (Single Sign-On). We used this on several projects so we&#8217;ve been aware of the End-of-Life deadline for awhile. On projects which did NOT need strong user-authentication, we&#8217;ve moved to 2FA using a TOTP (Time-based One Time Password). But we have one project that needed the strong authentication. This meeting was the first to figure out how best to deal with it going forward.</p>



<p>We fell behind on our <strong>‚™Æ Good Morning</strong> newsletter due to travel and work, but we&#8217;ll do our best to get 4 interesting links out for August.</p>



<p>We have some raw 180¬∞ spatial videos to test in a Vision Pro. So the VR Project is now in full swing! This is exciting and certainly will lead to more projects. The goal here is to make a prototype app and workflow. They customer wants to be able to replicate the workflow for several of their projects, but since no one&#8217;s done this before, we&#8217;re also learning what works, what doesn&#8217;t, what&#8217;s feasible and what has the &#8216;wow&#8217; factor. Then we can better harden the app to make the updates dynamic and improve the workflow for future projects.</p>



<p>Now that we&#8217;re a good 8 months into the year, we spent some time re-evaluating our hourly work-load on some projects and looking into our rent contract. Taking an average of expenses for just 1-2 months can miss a bunch of annual payments, but using the last 8 month (or even 20 if we include last year) gives us a better average monthly spend. Taking all these numbers, we&#8217;re looking to update our rates and workload in the fall and going into 02025.</p>



<p>The old adage about where to complain about Twitter when Twitter was down now applied to Mastodon! Our local instance is down. There were less than 100 people using it and even less active. I&#8217;m not sure if the owner is away or even aware, but it&#8217;s been a week and it isn&#8217;t back up. We partly don&#8217;t care, but it would be great to know if it is coming back-up so we can either continue or migrate our data somewhere else. Certainly a LOW priority these days.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #706</h2>



<p>We continue with the Miami project as it is slowing down for us. The remaining tasks are not as urgent and are cleaning-up and making the general experience better.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been getting back into Swift Programming. We had two goals this week: one was to get some Bonjour networking messages passed between two different devices and the second was working with some 3D models as navigation elements.</p>



<p>On Friday, we sent out <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/s03e08/">Season 3, Episode 8 of our ‚™Æ Good Morning newsletter</a>. It was a bit behind scheduled, but better late than never!</p>



<p>We also had our <a href="https://petals.team" data-type="link" data-id="petals.team">PETALS</a> sync where we went over tasks and reviewed the project status.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A double weeknote from the East of Iceland.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #702</h2>



<p>On Monday, <a href="https://lodfill.is/@briansuda/112830920744430631">we posted on social media some Puffin pictures</a> taken in Borgarfj√∂r√∞ur eystri. The post continued to get boosts for several days. The photos were taken with the <a href="https://hipstamatic.app/app/tintype">TinType app</a>, and two experimental apps we&#8217;ve been working on. The first is a series of filters, one attempts to emulate the <a href="https://www.lomography.com">LOMO camera look</a>. The other app was inspired by <a href="https://xavibou.com/ornithographies/">Xavi Bou&#8217;s ornithographies</a>. This app takes the video feed frames and flattens them using the &#8216;darken&#8217; blend mode. It creates these timelapses in a single image.</p>



<figure class="banner"><a href="https://lodfill.is/@briansuda/112830920744430631"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mastodon-1024x927.png" alt="Screenshot of the Mastodon post" /></a></figure>



<p>On Wednesday, we sent out our <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/s03e07/">seventh episode of the ‚™Æ Good Morning Newsletter</a>. You can read it <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/">online</a>, in your <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/subscribe/">inbox</a> or via <a href="https://optional.is/feeds/">RSS</a>. We send out monthly newsletters on various, interesting topics.</p>



<p>We continue to update the <a href="https://adventure-mazes.com">Adventure Maze</a> print-on-demand books. We moved from a themed amount of pages (24 pages for Christmas and 31 for Halloween) to just a simple 100 mazes per book. In doing so, we needed to re-setup all the entries on Amazon along with update the cover now that the spine has more pages along with the actual content. We&#8217;re not 100% done with all three books and they are available for sale! Next step, digital versions.</p>



<p>Since we moved office to Egilssta√∞ir, the place we&#8217;re staying doesn&#8217;t (or we can&#8217;t find) any dice. One app we&#8217;ve had on the back burner for awhile was an iMessages Dice Rolling app. It got bogged down in a lot of internal design decisions and has been stuck. Ignoring all that, we made a quick SwuiftUI dice roller for ourselves. There are probably plenty of web-based and app based dice rollers already, but as they say, there are also plenty of love songs and people still continue to write them!</p>



<p>Making our own Dice Roller app was a great little exercise. It is useful and a great example, tutorial project for anyone who wants to learn SwiftUI.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #703</h2>



<p><a href="https://briansuda.gumroad.com/l/am-bundle">The Adventure Mazes now have a Digital Bundle version</a>. We&#8217;re still experimenting with pricing, but for $9 (the price of one book) you get PDFs of all three books. We have additional book ideas in the pipeline, so the bundles will get updated accordingly. The effort is low to sell digital versions, so we thought we&#8217;d try and learn more in the process.</p>



<p>We made some stickers last week that finally arrived. They are a secret, so we can post any pictures (yet). Normally we used StickerMule for these sorts of projects. In the past the quality has been great and if you are not in a rush, they have weekly deals which are a fraction of the normal price. But recently, their CEO went and used the marketing mailing list to spam everyone about Trump.</p>



<p>Our Miami work continues. All the major backend tasks are wrapping-up and we&#8217;re going to be switching gears next week, but not sure to exactly what.</p>



<p>The big VR project continues to tick along. We&#8217;ve ported most of the code over to an iPad app and are now iterating with the client&#8217;s feedback on layout and content containers as the content is being produced.</p>



<p>We also got back into some analytics number crunching. We recently released some new features in an app and needed to keep an eye on the general performance. One of our partners also needed some numbers about how various characters were performing in game, so we had to dig-up both how many games they were choose, but the number of player who have unlocked those characters so we could normalize the data into some popularity ranking.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A double weeknote. The workload is high and we're changing offices to the other side of the country for a few weeks.
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #700</h2>



<p>On Monday, we had our Friday <a href="https://petals.team">PETALS</a> meet-up. We went over each of the screens. The goal is to clean-up some of the text and design, use the data to focus the story and general clean-up and bug fixes. The next few weeks are gong to be slow with PETALS, but it&#8217;s good to always have a backlog of small tasks when things are slow.</p>



<p>Miami Project is rumbling along. Bug fixes, feature requests and UI tweaks all coming in this week as they get more feedback from real customers.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been working on our <a href="https://adventure-mazes.com">Adventure Mazes</a> again. After a lot of feedback, we&#8217;ve realized that we needed to increase our page count in the books. Since all the mazes are generated in code, it was easy create a 100 page adventure maze book. A few minutes here and a few minutes there, we&#8217;ve been solving each maze just to confirm it is possible and made some small editorial changes to make it more fun. We want to prep this for the holiday season(s) and start to work on digital versions for download and print at home.</p>



<p>Another game proposal and prototype we made is moving to the next stage of its life-cycle. The feedback was well received and now we&#8217;re shifting some resources around to re-build it in Unity to see how far we can get easily.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been trying (and failing) to pry back some time for another VR project. We&#8217;re still in good shape because most of the content is not available yet, but it will be in a few weeks and everyone&#8217;s going to want to see some progress!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #701</h2>



<p>On Monday, we relocated the office to the other side of the country to Egilssta√∞ir for a few weeks. It will be a nice change of scenery and allow us to get a break from office construction. It is a long trip, but there are plenty of amazing scenery along the way.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iceland-collage.jpg" alt="Collage of photos from around Iceland" /></figure>



<p>This month was the start of the 3rd quarter, which means we sent out our <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/02024Q3/">Q3 quarternotes newsletter</a>. You can always subscribe via email and RSS, or just read the archives online at <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/">optional.is/newsletter/</a></p>



<p>The Miami project continues to rumble along. Every day, we make progress. It is in those exciting days of building something new for a customer, getting feedback and iterating on a daily basis. We&#8217;re not stuck in arguing about what feature to build or how to eke out 1% more performance from onboarding or how to increase D30 retention.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re getting back on track with our VR projects. Next week, there is a videography team going on location to record some video and photos for us to use on the VR headsets and tablet devices. We&#8217;ve been prepping most of app work with demo photos and videos, but it will be great to start to swap it out with real content.</p>



<p>Internally, we&#8217;ve been working on revamping some of our print-on-demand projects for Q4. We&#8217;ve tried to make it more digestible. If we can break it down into small enough tasks, there is hope we can get through all of them. Step 1: Take our three books and generate the additional content. <strong>3/3 Done</strong>. Step 2: Review that content and make adjustments. <strong>2/3 Done</strong>. Step 3: Merge those changes back into the source PDF. <strong>2/3 Done</strong>. Step 4: Re-publish the books on Amazon. <strong>2/3 Done</strong>. The final (optional) step is to update the logo. It was originally hand-drawn and is not balanced and was obviously done by someone right-handed. Step 1: Mathematically map out the design and redraw. <strong>Done.</strong> Step 2: Digitize to vectors. <strong>10% Done?</strong> Step 3: Update all instances of it. This is going to be a long process as we&#8217;ll continue to find it in places for a while.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Another double weeknote. We've been heads down on 2-3 projects and looking to develop our own products further to generate some passive income.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #698</h2>



<p>This week we wrote an article called <a href="https://optional.is/required/2024/06/25/network-plumbing/">Network Plumbing</a> about our current hardware network setup and how we got from old slow internet speeds to a much faster, better managed with a more feature rich internal network.</p>



<p>One summer project we have for our survey company is to improve our email templates. What we&#8217;ve been using is an older design that was massively tables in tables in tables. Over the years we&#8217;ve simplified the design to a single column. All those tables were just getting confusing and making things very hard to edit. While we&#8217;re working on streamlining the design, we took the opportunity to also get dark mode working in HTML newsletter emails. In the fall, once we start sending to customers, we&#8217;ll have to update all our communications 1-by-1, but we have the template ready to go!</p>



<p>For <a href="https://analog.is">Analog.is</a> we setup PayPal as a potential payment option, but we messed up the process so bad we had to call tech support to help. Their only solution was to delete the account so we could start over!</p>



<p>For another project, we&#8217;ve been requesting any internal documentation about their art templates. After lots of back-and-forth, it turns out they don&#8217;t have any and referred us to the (not so great) documentation on the web. We also got feedback about our FTUE funnel achievements and that wasn&#8217;t particularly helpful either!</p>



<p>Our Australian project is moving forward, slowly. Our contact is leaving so email replies have been not particularly useful. Luckily, we&#8217;re pretty far along and are hoping to wrap this up soon.</p>



<p>We met with some old co-workers again for a potential new project. We made a plan on getting back into the swing of things in the fall after all the school summer holidays.</p>



<p>Our Miami project is going strong! That team is moving very quickly and has demoed the product a few times now. We&#8217;re laying down the railroad tracks as the train is rumbling towards us!</p>



<p>Our VR project is also looking great. We&#8217;ve been doing a few more tests on visionOS 2.0 and there are several things that are going to really help-us make this project easier.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #699</h2>



<p>Our main focus this week was the Miami project. We&#8217;re bouncing between web and iOS and continuing with a customer and staff app. A lot of plumbing is now in place for Push Notifications and nightly cron-tasks to keep things in sync and all parties informed.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It is also the VSK time! Every two months we have to report our VAT to the tax man. Luckily the accounting software does all that for us, we just need to keep our expenses logged and bank accounts all reconciled.</p>



<p>Thursday was the 4th of July in the USA <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f1fa-1f1f8.png" alt="üá∫üá∏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f9e8.png" alt="üß®" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f386.png" alt="üéÜ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f387.png" alt="üéá" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. Things were very quiet and we managed to stay focused on a few other topics. Friday was also pretty quiet.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve started to set some internal goals to work a bit more on some of our products rather than services. We want to moves some of these Analog Notebooks and get back onto our Adventure Mazes and some new product ideas to generate some passive income.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A double weeknote covering a bunch of holidays and a few bigger projects.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #696</h2>



<p>On Monday, Apple&#8217;s Word Wide Developer Conference (WWDC) kicked off. We have several projects going on in the Apple ecosystem, so we&#8217;ve been keeping a close eye on some of the new software that&#8217;s coming out this year for various platforms.</p>



<p>We made several big steps in our office clean-up/shuffle. A while ago, we swapped office rooms which meant everything just got put into boxes, moved and forgotten about. This was also prompted by a bit of a hardware re-organization and upgrade. In the process and older 02018 Intel Mac mini freed-up and that&#8217;s now in the process of becoming the central file server. Which all ties back to improved back-ups and networking around the office.</p>



<p>The main focus for this week, and probably the summer, will be this Miami project. It is a mix of iOS and web admin/api. Things are now pretty focused and they got customer feedback. Now we&#8217;re just running forward on code, UI and prepping for some customer beta testing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #697</h2>



<p>On Monday, it was the 17th of June. In Iceland, that&#8217;s Independence Day. The office was mostly closed, but we had to deal with a few US meetings. Luckily, on Wednesday the 19th of June was Juneteenth, a public holiday in the US, so that was a bit of a lighter day since most people weren&#8217;t at work.</p>



<p>For another customer, we spent some time to create a summer todo list. That way, if anyone was out of tasks and people were away on holiday, there was always something to take from the pile that needed doing. One summer tasks was to refactor the HTML emails sent. We originally found a nice template and copied that. It was nested <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>s in <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>s. Which worked, but was really hard to edit. Over the years the design got simpler and simpler. Now there is no reason to keep it all table based. So we&#8217;re refactoring it all for modern devices and mobile mail clients. In the process it should be easier to update, maintain and we can add more features like &#8216;dark mode&#8217; support, fancier gmail actions all while reducing our potential spam score.</p>



<p>This week, we sent out our <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/s03e06/">‚™Æ Good Morning Season 3 Episode 6 newsletter</a>. This month&#8217;s theme was all about Bread and some strange interconnections.</p>



<p>On Wednesday we had a kickoff meeting for a project down in Australia. This is with a company who needs a better overview of their inventory and finances. We&#8217;re tasked with joining-up their inventory system, their accounting system and dashboards. Many of these services have an API, some don&#8217;t but do have CSV exports (which sort of counts as a bad API). For simplicity, this is going to be built using Google Colab (iPython Notebooks) to glue together the various services.</p>



<p>On Thursday, we were testing, deploying and fixing bugs while on the way to a demo! Everything went great, once it was in the hands of the customer, we found more bugs and issues, but that was exactly the point. We&#8217;ll iterate the rest of the week and regroup next week to readjust focus.</p>



<p>Friday was our bi-weekly PETALS meet-up. Our last meeting was with a few users of the system and they offered a bunch of great feedback. We&#8217;ve captured most of it as GitHub issues and fixed a few. Today&#8217;s meet-up was mostly to go over tasks, set some expectations and prepare for the summer slump.</p>



<p>One of the many small side-projects we&#8217;ve been working on has been smoldering behind the scenes. We&#8217;ve got 2-3 ideas and directions we could take this idea and we&#8217;ve got feelers out and pitching it in various forms. This week a new idea arose. We&#8217;re always wondered if this idea is the goal, or the tool to get your closer to your goal? Now, we&#8217;ve found a good flow to use this idea as the meta-goal, yet have it still make sense in the context of the bigger picture!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #694</h2>



<p>Monday was a public holiday in the US, so it was pretty quiet around here. We worked a bit on a CSV conversion project for an Australian company and put the finishing touches on that.</p>



<p>We had another meeting about our book idea. They were very receptive and willing to help sell it, but they weren&#8217;t willing to publish it. It was a stretch, but wanted to atleast make an offer. That two rejections now. We sent off to another publisher for feedback, but their process is incredibly annoying. We missed some cut-off date and now they won&#8217;t review it until mid-september (at the earliest) and it could take 10-12 weeks to get a reply. That&#8217;s December 1st! Which leaves no time for this to be available for Christmas. We like the plan ahead, but in this instance didn&#8217;t plan far enough.</p>



<p>We also managed to gave a morning coffee meeting with a friend about a LONG running old TV project idea. He was very receptive and had lots of ideas. Luckily, there is no deadline, but we wanted to get things percolating and meet-up before the summer break.</p>



<p>On our never ending quest for backups and storage, we picked-up another 4TB NAS drive and put that into the QNAP DAS. Which mean we went straight into the account software and logged it. (A stitch in time, saves nine). That also prompted-us to get the accounting books all balanced. Having a USD account means things never quite add-up due to exchange rate fluctuations and banking fees, but we&#8217;re in a good spot now.</p>



<p>The QNAP DAS which was connected to the router effectively made it a NAS drive (sort of). We setup an rsync script to back-up a few different sources back to the new 4TB drive for redundancy. We tried the RAID, but for now having an error immediately write to two places was a bit too scary, we want a bit of delay, so a nightly rsync is now in place. The next issues is that the rsync wasn&#8217;t happening on the router, but on a desktop machine. Doing a 4TB+ rsync over the wifi was not working, so we&#8217;re in the process of shuffling around these drives back to a server on the network, which also means changing the network topology a bit. (More on that in week #695)</p>



<p>Throughout the week, we continued working on a prototype for a company down in Miami. They are moving fast and are much more focused on their project. That means we have much better directives and goals for the prototype.</p>



<p>We took some time to setup <a href="https://obsproject.com">OBS</a> (Open Broadcasting Software) on an old computer. We connected our ring light, USB Microphone and other devices to an older laptop to make a recording station. After a little learning curve, we managed to jump right into some picture-in-a-picture screen sharing action. It worked really well and hopefully we&#8217;ll be able todo something with this in the near future.</p>



<p>We had a meeting on Friday about a potential new project. It was great to say no. After the meeting and learning more about the team, we&#8217;re confident that we&#8217;re not the best fit for this project. It would take too much time and too much hand holding, which we don&#8217;t have time for. We gave them some advice and are willing to spot check anything they need help with, but we can&#8217;t do any day-to-day work.</p>



<p>It is the end of the month this week. We managed to send off two big invoices which have a good turn around payment and the smaller regular payments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #695</h2>



<p>In our quest to improve our network topology, we shuffled around a few routers. We currently have 3 routers, 2 older Airport Extremes and 1 new Unifi Express. The Airports are great and the tech inside (WiFi 6e) is still on part with stuff you buy today. They are also super simple to setup, handle backups and play well in an Apple ecosystem. Sadly, they are no longer produced and we needed more coverage over two floors. The Unifi express is a great and powerful little router, but it only has 1 LAN port so it ended-up being an edge node. That caused issues because the Unifi router wasn&#8217;t really extending the network, but instead creating a new subnet.</p>



<p>This week, we bought a small Unifi flex mini switch. That allowed us to move the Unifi Express to the main network node connected to the WAN, add the switch to the LAN and then (up to) four more routers extending that network. Now everything is on the same subnet and all the devices can see each other. The other bonus is that we can take advantage of all that Unifi has to offer. The biggest is the ability to VPN back to the network from outside. The Airports has the ability to port-forward, but the VPN server is built into the Unifi hardware!</p>



<p>We had a kick-off meeting for another project down in Australia. This one is another data-bridge style project where a company has their inventory data in one system and needs to get the shipping info into another along with general data into a 3rd analytics tool. Luckily, we can use more APIs and (hopefully) automate more of this workflow.</p>



<p>Our two Miami projects continue on pace. Hopefully, we&#8217;ll be able to talk more about these in the future.</p>



<p>Next week is Apple&#8217;s WWDC conference. Some co-workers will be there for meetings, so we&#8217;re making lists of questions to get answered in-person.</p>



<p>Our two big invoices were paid this week. Our accounts are all balanced and VAT reports sent in.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #692</h2>



<p>We&#8217;ve been tinkering with an analog book of games. We printed a few awhile ago using the Kindle Direct Printing service to get some feedback. This week, we took a second iteration based on feedback and printed some more. We&#8217;ve also updated the code to be a bit more flexible for different output sizes (US Letter, A4, 9&#215;6, etc.) and multiple languages, English, Spanish and Icelandic are supported. Now that we&#8217;re in a good, flexible spot, we took this to a local publisher to show them. They funneled us through their submission process and in Week #693, we got a rejection: &#8220;This is not for us&#8221;. Fair enough. So we brought it to another organization who doesn&#8217;t do publishing, but does go games. We&#8217;ll see where this takes us. It is good to document all the setbacks and rejections along the way. We tend to only ever see the &#8220;highlight reels&#8221; without understanding the mountain of effort that got there.</p>



<p>This week we finished-up US taxes and reviewed our local VAT submission. Fun stuff for sure.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/usb-c-extender.jpg" alt="Two USB-C Cables with a small port-to-port extender"/></figure>



<p>Recently we purchased a USB-C to USB-C port-to-port adapter. Using this we can extend the length of 2 USB-C cabled. The reason we&#8217;re excited about this, is because we have a USB-C cable with a small LED screen which tells you the power-draw on it. That&#8217;s great when you have a USB-C device, but we have several Apple Lightening cables, some USB-A, Qi charging mats, watch chargers, USB-A to USB-C converters and more. With this adapter, we can examine which cables/adapters might be throttling the charging power.</p>



<p>For instance, we have an Apple USB-C plug to USB-A port. This was released early on when Apple&#8217;s laptops dropped all USB-A ports in favor of USB-C, but lots of things still had USB-A plugs. Little did we know that no matter what wattage power brick you plug that into, the adapter won&#8217;t push more than 5W of power through? That means your fancy iPhone (which can charge up to 27W) or iPad (which can charge at 30W) won&#8217;t draw more than 5W of power through that adapter! </p>



<p>You can imaging we were plugging lots of stuff in and our all afternoon trying to optimize and get an overview of our equipment.</p>



<p>On Thursday, the remote team scheduled a long introspection call. It was good to air some grievances about the process this last 1-2 years and we&#8217;re making some plans to update our internal processes and solidify the core team. Along with all this, we&#8217;re deciding what it is this group wants todo in the future and what we want to represent.</p>



<p>PETALS marches on! On Friday, we tried to have another sync, but the internet wasn&#8217;t helping. We did manage to cover some of the important things, what got done and what else needs doing. We&#8217;ll pick-up this project again in a week or two.</p>



<p>For another project, we&#8217;re tasked with exploring how to build an app in VR to display 360 videos. The ability to map a video texture onto the inside of a sphere is pretty trivial. The bigger task now is to explore the UI/UX of watching in the round, but also being able to pause/play/exit without too much UI interfering with the video. Then there are issues with codex, file-size, storage, etc. Ironically, the easy part was playing the video!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #693</h2>



<p>Monday was a Bank Holiday here in Iceland, the celebration of <em>Whit Monday</em>. That put us a bit behind schedule since several of our international clients didn&#8217;t have today off.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, we sent out our <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/s03e05/">‚™Æ Good Morning s03e05 newsletter all about Endangered Food</a>. We also had an electrician come over todo some wiring for new light switches. We took the opportunity to also do a bit of network re-wiring. One of the office rooms is one thick concert wall and one thick concrete floor away from the nearest router. It was almost a dead-zone for WiFi. With the electrician&#8217;s help, we drilled a small hole through the wall and floor and ran some ethernet cables. We went from speeds of ~80Mbps (wireless) to a 1.2Gbps (wired). Sometimes a little hole is all it takes! </p>



<p>We have one project from Australia which is shaping-up. This is a simple project (or so we thought) to convert a bunch of CSVs in one format, into a single CSV of a different format for Fathom. At first we thought this might be a good project to ask some LLM for help, but once we started, it was so straight forward, it was easier to run with it and use our own knowledge than wait for AI prompts to spit out an overly verbose answer line-by-line. After a few back and forths, I think this project is pretty much wrapped-up.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, we met with a customer who&#8217;s using Iceland&#8217;s Single Sign-On service. As of September, they are shutting down version 1 and pushing people to version 2, but the catch is that you need to be a governmental organization to join version 2. Which puts a lot of companies struggling to find an alternative. We&#8217;ve been pretty pro-active moving to TOTP 2FA QR codes where we can, but our client&#8217;s service needs more proof of who you are than 2FA can provide. There is a private alternative, but it is expensive and (from the last time we looked) tricky to implement. Our client was surprised, because they have other projects using the Island.is Electronic Id service and none of those contractors have given them any heads-up about the fact it is closing in 3 months.</p>



<p>We continued with two projects from the Miami, Florida area. Both are stealth projects and we&#8217;re building prototypes. These really feel like we&#8217;re laying down tracks as the train in is barreling down on us. Then at the last minute, it changes direction and we start putting track down elsewhere. Sometimes, it&#8217;s fun to build this way, especially when there is constant communications with the customer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bric-√†-brac</h2>



<p>Two potential links for a future newsletter, but we&#8217;ll post them here for now.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazen_head">Brazen Head</a> was a brass automaton from the early period. It was a sort of an all knowing oracle. You could easily read that wikipedia article and easy think it was written today about AI. It just goes to show you that for 1,000+ years people have been searching for &#8216;the all knowing&#8217;.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pickle_for_the_Knowing_Ones">A Pickle for the Knowing Ones</a> is a book written in 01802 by Timothy Dexter. The story of this man&#8217;s life could easily be the focus of a movie. Everyone tried to trick him into doing something financially silly and it turned out to be a wind-fall. Maybe he was a time-traveller from the future who already knew he couldn&#8217;t loose!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A triple weeknote, but the week in the middle we were mostly out of the office/country.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #689</h2>



<p>We&#8217;ve been working on an internal project this week. We&#8217;ve teamed-up with some old co-workers and went deep, fast on this little app. Given our years of expertise and 3 attempts and this sort of game, we&#8217;ve got a wealth of knowledge of what works and what doesn&#8217;t. Our goal is to get a working prototype, a slide deck, then shop it around a bit.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, we crammed in several meetings before our time off. It was good to collect information and set some realistic goals and deadlines so we could hit the ground running when we&#8217;re back.</p>



<p>Thursday was a public holiday in Iceland. It is the First Day of Summer. It seems an ironically early date for summer in Iceland, but when you remember that the year is only split into two seasons; winter and summer, not the four that more mid-latitude countries have, it makes sense. We took the opportunity to close-up the office until week #691 and use this and the May 1st bank holidays to travel.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #690</h2>



<p>This week was spent traveling and client work was put on hold. We did get to see and interact with a bunch of interesting exhibitions and technologies. For instance, RFID/NFC cards that were used to access doors, activate drinking fountains, access tickets and a login token to continue your progress from station to station. Lot of ideas are rattling around. This simple, cheap, unique identifier tokens are a great alternative to requiring a smart phone.</p>



<p>We played with an exhibition that 3D scans your LEGO creation, then injects it into a top-down driving video games. It was a lot of fun to watch and see. Designing a physical museum piece that will be used by lots and lots of people repeatedly is harder than doing it in software! Physical things wear down and break, digital bits are more resilient and easier to change.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/lego.jpg" alt="Collage of LEGO Car Builder"/>
<figcaption>Collage of images of the LEGO car 3D scanner and the projected video game the car was put into.</figcaption>
</figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #691</h2>



<p>This week we&#8217;re back in the office picking-up on client tasks right where we left-off. We have around 10 projects on the go at the moment. Each is in various forms of &#8220;completion&#8221;. Our spring surveys are wrapped-up, we just need to do some final reporting of the data. Some new projects have been prototyped, others are still drafts. Others are longer and will be ongoing for awhile.</p>



<p>On Monday, we had a meeting with an Australian company about some data conversion. They use a proprietary legacy system from their supplier, but want to get their monthly P&amp;L into <a href="https://www.fathomhq.com">Fathom</a> to do better reporting. We&#8217;re tasked with a &#8216;data bridge&#8217; to aid in the conversions when there is no easy API integration. On Friday, we got the green-light to start building. This is a small-ish project to build, but will take awhile to get the edge-cases worked out.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, we closed another project with a company in Miami, Florida USA. We are starting with a prototype. They have a design partner lined-up which will give great feedback. Our task is to get the backend web service setup, the SwiftUI iOS app and the corresponding APIs. Someone else will be working on the Android version, based on our code.</p>



<p>Through-out the week, we continue to work on our internal project with some old co-workers. It is really taking shape and we managed to pitch it a bit more internally. That amounted to a few long conversations and yet another idea! (The domain has already been registered!)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bric-√†-brac</h2>



<p>Since our last update, we were listening to a podcast interview with <a href="https://benwillbond.com">Ben Willbond</a>. He&#8217;s probably best known for acting in the UK TV series <em>Ghosts</em> or <em>Horrible Histories</em>. In the interview, there was a throw-away comment about the Edinburgh Fringe festival where he and Arn Widdowson appeared as a French rap, pop and rock parody duo, <em>Priorit√© √† Gauche</em>. That would normally not be anything special, except that back in 02003, we saw them perform at the Edinburgh Fringe! (Although at the time, it was probably Justin McCarron instead of Ben Willbond) It was a VERY memorable show we still think about today!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This was a double weeknote with a lot  of task juggling. On any given day, we'd touch 3-4 different client projects. It was fun, but exhausting.]]></description>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #687</h2>



<p>We started the week with a few potentially new projects down-under in Australia. Most of these projects fall into custom software development: Data Bridge category. Companies have data in one silo and need to get it into another. For example, exporting data from an inventory system and bring it into a packaging software. APIs to export, massage that data into a new format, and APIs (hopefully) to import it into something else. Software Plumbers at your service.</p>



<p>Wednesday morning, we met-up with some other seasoned VR folks and had a chat about what&#8217;s up, what new and what everyone&#8217;s looking forward too. It&#8217;s great to get a lay of the land from out-side your own bubble and to mingle a bit more to let people know what we&#8217;re up too.</p>



<p>On Thursday, we sent our <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/02024Q2/">‚óç Quarternotes 02024Q2 newsletter</a>. This is our quarterly newsletter covering some of the happenings in the company along with some interesting links.</p>



<p>We ended the week with two interesting project meetings. The first was like a phoenix rising from the ashes of a defunct project that crashed and burned a few months prior. Some of the team have dusted themselves of, and started again and want our help. This was a great first-meeting and we&#8217;re excited to work on the project.</p>



<p>The second meeting was even more interesting and top-secret. The first 5 minutes to a swerve we weren&#8217;t expecting with a crazy potential new project, but the pendulum swung back to the tasks at hand. It was great to meet Walid and his team. What we proposed as the software solution is a pretty &#8220;quick win&#8221; and we&#8217;re itching to get started. At some point, we should convince the client to spend less time in meetings and use those hours to explore in prototyping. We&#8217;re nearly there.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #688</h2>



<p>On Monday, we did the swap-over dance with one of our surveys. This is the last month of big survey work in the spring time. Things are going smoothly as we continue to email, sms and call participants.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, we sent out the <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/s03e04/">‚™Æ Good Morning s03e04 newsletter</a>. This is our growing newsletter that covers just 4-topic each episode, no self-promotion.</p>



<p>As we near the end of island.is (Iceland&#8217;s Single Sign On Service) for non-governmental agencies, we&#8217;re moving to TOTP (Timed-Based One-Time Passwords) from a QR code into some Authenticator app. Most of our customers are not expected to be so technical that they will already have an app. That means some very verbose, clear instructions on how to set this up.</p>



<p>The last two weeks we&#8217;ve ramped-up our free time on a quazi internal project: <em>Q-Arriba</em>. We&#8217;re very happy how well and fast it has come along. I guess that&#8217;s what years of experience gets you. You get to skip all the previous mistakes and get straight into the harder stuff.</p>



<p>On Friday, we had our fortnightly PETALS sync. We have our first external customer onboarded and will use it with their team and send some feedback. This is a big step, because previously we could break things and no one would notice, now we&#8217;ve gotten get much more professional in our deployments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fluxcapacitor</h2>



<p>It is fascinating to look back at <a href="https://optional.is/required/2018/04/20/week-375/">a weeknote from 6 years ago</a>. Some of the comments feels like yesterday, others feel like a world away, yet they happened in the same week.</p>
