<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #700</h2>



<p>On Monday, we had our Friday <a href="https://petals.team">PETALS</a> meet-up. We went over each of the screens. The goal is to clean-up some of the text and design, use the data to focus the story and general clean-up and bug fixes. The next few weeks are gong to be slow with PETALS, but it&#8217;s good to always have a backlog of small tasks when things are slow.</p>



<p>Miami Project is rumbling along. Bug fixes, feature requests and UI tweaks all coming in this week as they get more feedback from real customers.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been working on our <a href="https://adventure-mazes.com">Adventure Mazes</a> again. After a lot of feedback, we&#8217;ve realized that we needed to increase our page count in the books. Since all the mazes are generated in code, it was easy create a 100 page adventure maze book. A few minutes here and a few minutes there, we&#8217;ve been solving each maze just to confirm it is possible and made some small editorial changes to make it more fun. We want to prep this for the holiday season(s) and start to work on digital versions for download and print at home.</p>



<p>Another game proposal and prototype we made is moving to the next stage of its life-cycle. The feedback was well received and now we&#8217;re shifting some resources around to re-build it in Unity to see how far we can get easily.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been trying (and failing) to pry back some time for another VR project. We&#8217;re still in good shape because most of the content is not available yet, but it will be in a few weeks and everyone&#8217;s going to want to see some progress!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #701</h2>



<p>On Monday, we relocated the office to the other side of the country to Egilsstaðir for a few weeks. It will be a nice change of scenery and allow us to get a break from office construction. It is a long trip, but there are plenty of amazing scenery along the way.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iceland-collage.jpg" alt="Collage of photos from around Iceland" /></figure>



<p>This month was the start of the 3rd quarter, which means we sent out our <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/02024Q3/">Q3 quarternotes newsletter</a>. You can always subscribe via email and RSS, or just read the archives online at <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/">optional.is/newsletter/</a></p>



<p>The Miami project continues to rumble along. Every day, we make progress. It is in those exciting days of building something new for a customer, getting feedback and iterating on a daily basis. We&#8217;re not stuck in arguing about what feature to build or how to eke out 1% more performance from onboarding or how to increase D30 retention.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re getting back on track with our VR projects. Next week, there is a videography team going on location to record some video and photos for us to use on the VR headsets and tablet devices. We&#8217;ve been prepping most of app work with demo photos and videos, but it will be great to start to swap it out with real content.</p>



<p>Internally, we&#8217;ve been working on revamping some of our print-on-demand projects for Q4. We&#8217;ve tried to make it more digestible. If we can break it down into small enough tasks, there is hope we can get through all of them. Step 1: Take our three books and generate the additional content. <strong>3/3 Done</strong>. Step 2: Review that content and make adjustments. <strong>2/3 Done</strong>. Step 3: Merge those changes back into the source PDF. <strong>2/3 Done</strong>. Step 4: Re-publish the books on Amazon. <strong>2/3 Done</strong>. The final (optional) step is to update the logo. It was originally hand-drawn and is not balanced and was obviously done by someone right-handed. Step 1: Mathematically map out the design and redraw. <strong>Done.</strong> Step 2: Digitize to vectors. <strong>10% Done?</strong> Step 3: Update all instances of it. This is going to be a long process as we&#8217;ll continue to find it in places for a while.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Another double weeknote. We've been heads down on 2-3 projects and looking to develop our own products further to generate some passive income.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #698</h2>



<p>This week we wrote an article called <a href="https://optional.is/required/2024/06/25/network-plumbing/">Network Plumbing</a> about our current hardware network setup and how we got from old slow internet speeds to a much faster, better managed with a more feature rich internal network.</p>



<p>One summer project we have for our survey company is to improve our email templates. What we&#8217;ve been using is an older design that was massively tables in tables in tables. Over the years we&#8217;ve simplified the design to a single column. All those tables were just getting confusing and making things very hard to edit. While we&#8217;re working on streamlining the design, we took the opportunity to also get dark mode working in HTML newsletter emails. In the fall, once we start sending to customers, we&#8217;ll have to update all our communications 1-by-1, but we have the template ready to go!</p>



<p>For <a href="https://analog.is">Analog.is</a> we setup PayPal as a potential payment option, but we messed up the process so bad we had to call tech support to help. Their only solution was to delete the account so we could start over!</p>



<p>For another project, we&#8217;ve been requesting any internal documentation about their art templates. After lots of back-and-forth, it turns out they don&#8217;t have any and referred us to the (not so great) documentation on the web. We also got feedback about our FTUE funnel achievements and that wasn&#8217;t particularly helpful either!</p>



<p>Our Australian project is moving forward, slowly. Our contact is leaving so email replies have been not particularly useful. Luckily, we&#8217;re pretty far along and are hoping to wrap this up soon.</p>



<p>We met with some old co-workers again for a potential new project. We made a plan on getting back into the swing of things in the fall after all the school summer holidays.</p>



<p>Our Miami project is going strong! That team is moving very quickly and has demoed the product a few times now. We&#8217;re laying down the railroad tracks as the train is rumbling towards us!</p>



<p>Our VR project is also looking great. We&#8217;ve been doing a few more tests on visionOS 2.0 and there are several things that are going to really help-us make this project easier.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #699</h2>



<p>Our main focus this week was the Miami project. We&#8217;re bouncing between web and iOS and continuing with a customer and staff app. A lot of plumbing is now in place for Push Notifications and nightly cron-tasks to keep things in sync and all parties informed.</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">It is also the VSK time! Every two months we have to report our VAT to the tax man. Luckily the accounting software does all that for us, we just need to keep our expenses logged and bank accounts all reconciled.</p>



<p>Thursday was the 4th of July in the USA <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f1fa-1f1f8.png" alt="🇺🇸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f9e8.png" alt="🧨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f386.png" alt="🎆" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f387.png" alt="🎇" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. Things were very quiet and we managed to stay focused on a few other topics. Friday was also pretty quiet.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve started to set some internal goals to work a bit more on some of our products rather than services. We want to moves some of these Analog Notebooks and get back onto our Adventure Mazes and some new product ideas to generate some passive income.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A double weeknote covering a bunch of holidays and a few bigger projects.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #696</h2>



<p>On Monday, Apple&#8217;s Word Wide Developer Conference (WWDC) kicked off. We have several projects going on in the Apple ecosystem, so we&#8217;ve been keeping a close eye on some of the new software that&#8217;s coming out this year for various platforms.</p>



<p>We made several big steps in our office clean-up/shuffle. A while ago, we swapped office rooms which meant everything just got put into boxes, moved and forgotten about. This was also prompted by a bit of a hardware re-organization and upgrade. In the process and older 02018 Intel Mac mini freed-up and that&#8217;s now in the process of becoming the central file server. Which all ties back to improved back-ups and networking around the office.</p>



<p>The main focus for this week, and probably the summer, will be this Miami project. It is a mix of iOS and web admin/api. Things are now pretty focused and they got customer feedback. Now we&#8217;re just running forward on code, UI and prepping for some customer beta testing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #697</h2>



<p>On Monday, it was the 17th of June. In Iceland, that&#8217;s Independence Day. The office was mostly closed, but we had to deal with a few US meetings. Luckily, on Wednesday the 19th of June was Juneteenth, a public holiday in the US, so that was a bit of a lighter day since most people weren&#8217;t at work.</p>



<p>For another customer, we spent some time to create a summer todo list. That way, if anyone was out of tasks and people were away on holiday, there was always something to take from the pile that needed doing. One summer tasks was to refactor the HTML emails sent. We originally found a nice template and copied that. It was nested <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>s in <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>s. Which worked, but was really hard to edit. Over the years the design got simpler and simpler. Now there is no reason to keep it all table based. So we&#8217;re refactoring it all for modern devices and mobile mail clients. In the process it should be easier to update, maintain and we can add more features like &#8216;dark mode&#8217; support, fancier gmail actions all while reducing our potential spam score.</p>



<p>This week, we sent out our <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/s03e06/">⪮ Good Morning Season 3 Episode 6 newsletter</a>. This month&#8217;s theme was all about Bread and some strange interconnections.</p>



<p>On Wednesday we had a kickoff meeting for a project down in Australia. This is with a company who needs a better overview of their inventory and finances. We&#8217;re tasked with joining-up their inventory system, their accounting system and dashboards. Many of these services have an API, some don&#8217;t but do have CSV exports (which sort of counts as a bad API). For simplicity, this is going to be built using Google Colab (iPython Notebooks) to glue together the various services.</p>



<p>On Thursday, we were testing, deploying and fixing bugs while on the way to a demo! Everything went great, once it was in the hands of the customer, we found more bugs and issues, but that was exactly the point. We&#8217;ll iterate the rest of the week and regroup next week to readjust focus.</p>



<p>Friday was our bi-weekly PETALS meet-up. Our last meeting was with a few users of the system and they offered a bunch of great feedback. We&#8217;ve captured most of it as GitHub issues and fixed a few. Today&#8217;s meet-up was mostly to go over tasks, set some expectations and prepare for the summer slump.</p>



<p>One of the many small side-projects we&#8217;ve been working on has been smoldering behind the scenes. We&#8217;ve got 2-3 ideas and directions we could take this idea and we&#8217;ve got feelers out and pitching it in various forms. This week a new idea arose. We&#8217;re always wondered if this idea is the goal, or the tool to get your closer to your goal? Now, we&#8217;ve found a good flow to use this idea as the meta-goal, yet have it still make sense in the context of the bigger picture!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A double weeknote covering a bunch of networking updates and projects]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #694</h2>



<p>Monday was a public holiday in the US, so it was pretty quiet around here. We worked a bit on a CSV conversion project for an Australian company and put the finishing touches on that.</p>



<p>We had another meeting about our book idea. They were very receptive and willing to help sell it, but they weren&#8217;t willing to publish it. It was a stretch, but wanted to atleast make an offer. That two rejections now. We sent off to another publisher for feedback, but their process is incredibly annoying. We missed some cut-off date and now they won&#8217;t review it until mid-september (at the earliest) and it could take 10-12 weeks to get a reply. That&#8217;s December 1st! Which leaves no time for this to be available for Christmas. We like the plan ahead, but in this instance didn&#8217;t plan far enough.</p>



<p>We also managed to gave a morning coffee meeting with a friend about a LONG running old TV project idea. He was very receptive and had lots of ideas. Luckily, there is no deadline, but we wanted to get things percolating and meet-up before the summer break.</p>



<p>On our never ending quest for backups and storage, we picked-up another 4TB NAS drive and put that into the QNAP DAS. Which mean we went straight into the account software and logged it. (A stitch in time, saves nine). That also prompted-us to get the accounting books all balanced. Having a USD account means things never quite add-up due to exchange rate fluctuations and banking fees, but we&#8217;re in a good spot now.</p>



<p>The QNAP DAS which was connected to the router effectively made it a NAS drive (sort of). We setup an rsync script to back-up a few different sources back to the new 4TB drive for redundancy. We tried the RAID, but for now having an error immediately write to two places was a bit too scary, we want a bit of delay, so a nightly rsync is now in place. The next issues is that the rsync wasn&#8217;t happening on the router, but on a desktop machine. Doing a 4TB+ rsync over the wifi was not working, so we&#8217;re in the process of shuffling around these drives back to a server on the network, which also means changing the network topology a bit. (More on that in week #695)</p>



<p>Throughout the week, we continued working on a prototype for a company down in Miami. They are moving fast and are much more focused on their project. That means we have much better directives and goals for the prototype.</p>



<p>We took some time to setup <a href="https://obsproject.com">OBS</a> (Open Broadcasting Software) on an old computer. We connected our ring light, USB Microphone and other devices to an older laptop to make a recording station. After a little learning curve, we managed to jump right into some picture-in-a-picture screen sharing action. It worked really well and hopefully we&#8217;ll be able todo something with this in the near future.</p>



<p>We had a meeting on Friday about a potential new project. It was great to say no. After the meeting and learning more about the team, we&#8217;re confident that we&#8217;re not the best fit for this project. It would take too much time and too much hand holding, which we don&#8217;t have time for. We gave them some advice and are willing to spot check anything they need help with, but we can&#8217;t do any day-to-day work.</p>



<p>It is the end of the month this week. We managed to send off two big invoices which have a good turn around payment and the smaller regular payments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #695</h2>



<p>In our quest to improve our network topology, we shuffled around a few routers. We currently have 3 routers, 2 older Airport Extremes and 1 new Unifi Express. The Airports are great and the tech inside (WiFi 6e) is still on part with stuff you buy today. They are also super simple to setup, handle backups and play well in an Apple ecosystem. Sadly, they are no longer produced and we needed more coverage over two floors. The Unifi express is a great and powerful little router, but it only has 1 LAN port so it ended-up being an edge node. That caused issues because the Unifi router wasn&#8217;t really extending the network, but instead creating a new subnet.</p>



<p>This week, we bought a small Unifi flex mini switch. That allowed us to move the Unifi Express to the main network node connected to the WAN, add the switch to the LAN and then (up to) four more routers extending that network. Now everything is on the same subnet and all the devices can see each other. The other bonus is that we can take advantage of all that Unifi has to offer. The biggest is the ability to VPN back to the network from outside. The Airports has the ability to port-forward, but the VPN server is built into the Unifi hardware!</p>



<p>We had a kick-off meeting for another project down in Australia. This one is another data-bridge style project where a company has their inventory data in one system and needs to get the shipping info into another along with general data into a 3rd analytics tool. Luckily, we can use more APIs and (hopefully) automate more of this workflow.</p>



<p>Our two Miami projects continue on pace. Hopefully, we&#8217;ll be able to talk more about these in the future.</p>



<p>Next week is Apple&#8217;s WWDC conference. Some co-workers will be there for meetings, so we&#8217;re making lists of questions to get answered in-person.</p>



<p>Our two big invoices were paid this week. Our accounts are all balanced and VAT reports sent in.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #692</h2>



<p>We&#8217;ve been tinkering with an analog book of games. We printed a few awhile ago using the Kindle Direct Printing service to get some feedback. This week, we took a second iteration based on feedback and printed some more. We&#8217;ve also updated the code to be a bit more flexible for different output sizes (US Letter, A4, 9&#215;6, etc.) and multiple languages, English, Spanish and Icelandic are supported. Now that we&#8217;re in a good, flexible spot, we took this to a local publisher to show them. They funneled us through their submission process and in Week #693, we got a rejection: &#8220;This is not for us&#8221;. Fair enough. So we brought it to another organization who doesn&#8217;t do publishing, but does go games. We&#8217;ll see where this takes us. It is good to document all the setbacks and rejections along the way. We tend to only ever see the &#8220;highlight reels&#8221; without understanding the mountain of effort that got there.</p>



<p>This week we finished-up US taxes and reviewed our local VAT submission. Fun stuff for sure.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/usb-c-extender.jpg" alt="Two USB-C Cables with a small port-to-port extender"/></figure>



<p>Recently we purchased a USB-C to USB-C port-to-port adapter. Using this we can extend the length of 2 USB-C cabled. The reason we&#8217;re excited about this, is because we have a USB-C cable with a small LED screen which tells you the power-draw on it. That&#8217;s great when you have a USB-C device, but we have several Apple Lightening cables, some USB-A, Qi charging mats, watch chargers, USB-A to USB-C converters and more. With this adapter, we can examine which cables/adapters might be throttling the charging power.</p>



<p>For instance, we have an Apple USB-C plug to USB-A port. This was released early on when Apple&#8217;s laptops dropped all USB-A ports in favor of USB-C, but lots of things still had USB-A plugs. Little did we know that no matter what wattage power brick you plug that into, the adapter won&#8217;t push more than 5W of power through? That means your fancy iPhone (which can charge up to 27W) or iPad (which can charge at 30W) won&#8217;t draw more than 5W of power through that adapter! </p>



<p>You can imaging we were plugging lots of stuff in and our all afternoon trying to optimize and get an overview of our equipment.</p>



<p>On Thursday, the remote team scheduled a long introspection call. It was good to air some grievances about the process this last 1-2 years and we&#8217;re making some plans to update our internal processes and solidify the core team. Along with all this, we&#8217;re deciding what it is this group wants todo in the future and what we want to represent.</p>



<p>PETALS marches on! On Friday, we tried to have another sync, but the internet wasn&#8217;t helping. We did manage to cover some of the important things, what got done and what else needs doing. We&#8217;ll pick-up this project again in a week or two.</p>



<p>For another project, we&#8217;re tasked with exploring how to build an app in VR to display 360 videos. The ability to map a video texture onto the inside of a sphere is pretty trivial. The bigger task now is to explore the UI/UX of watching in the round, but also being able to pause/play/exit without too much UI interfering with the video. Then there are issues with codex, file-size, storage, etc. Ironically, the easy part was playing the video!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #693</h2>



<p>Monday was a Bank Holiday here in Iceland, the celebration of <em>Whit Monday</em>. That put us a bit behind schedule since several of our international clients didn&#8217;t have today off.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, we sent out our <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/s03e05/">⪮ Good Morning s03e05 newsletter all about Endangered Food</a>. We also had an electrician come over todo some wiring for new light switches. We took the opportunity to also do a bit of network re-wiring. One of the office rooms is one thick concert wall and one thick concrete floor away from the nearest router. It was almost a dead-zone for WiFi. With the electrician&#8217;s help, we drilled a small hole through the wall and floor and ran some ethernet cables. We went from speeds of ~80Mbps (wireless) to a 1.2Gbps (wired). Sometimes a little hole is all it takes! </p>



<p>We have one project from Australia which is shaping-up. This is a simple project (or so we thought) to convert a bunch of CSVs in one format, into a single CSV of a different format for Fathom. At first we thought this might be a good project to ask some LLM for help, but once we started, it was so straight forward, it was easier to run with it and use our own knowledge than wait for AI prompts to spit out an overly verbose answer line-by-line. After a few back and forths, I think this project is pretty much wrapped-up.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, we met with a customer who&#8217;s using Iceland&#8217;s Single Sign-On service. As of September, they are shutting down version 1 and pushing people to version 2, but the catch is that you need to be a governmental organization to join version 2. Which puts a lot of companies struggling to find an alternative. We&#8217;ve been pretty pro-active moving to TOTP 2FA QR codes where we can, but our client&#8217;s service needs more proof of who you are than 2FA can provide. There is a private alternative, but it is expensive and (from the last time we looked) tricky to implement. Our client was surprised, because they have other projects using the Island.is Electronic Id service and none of those contractors have given them any heads-up about the fact it is closing in 3 months.</p>



<p>We continued with two projects from the Miami, Florida area. Both are stealth projects and we&#8217;re building prototypes. These really feel like we&#8217;re laying down tracks as the train in is barreling down on us. Then at the last minute, it changes direction and we start putting track down elsewhere. Sometimes, it&#8217;s fun to build this way, especially when there is constant communications with the customer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bric-à-brac</h2>



<p>Two potential links for a future newsletter, but we&#8217;ll post them here for now.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazen_head">Brazen Head</a> was a brass automaton from the early period. It was a sort of an all knowing oracle. You could easily read that wikipedia article and easy think it was written today about AI. It just goes to show you that for 1,000+ years people have been searching for &#8216;the all knowing&#8217;.</p>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pickle_for_the_Knowing_Ones">A Pickle for the Knowing Ones</a> is a book written in 01802 by Timothy Dexter. The story of this man&#8217;s life could easily be the focus of a movie. Everyone tried to trick him into doing something financially silly and it turned out to be a wind-fall. Maybe he was a time-traveller from the future who already knew he couldn&#8217;t loose!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A triple weeknote, but the week in the middle we were mostly out of the office/country.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #689</h2>



<p>We&#8217;ve been working on an internal project this week. We&#8217;ve teamed-up with some old co-workers and went deep, fast on this little app. Given our years of expertise and 3 attempts and this sort of game, we&#8217;ve got a wealth of knowledge of what works and what doesn&#8217;t. Our goal is to get a working prototype, a slide deck, then shop it around a bit.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, we crammed in several meetings before our time off. It was good to collect information and set some realistic goals and deadlines so we could hit the ground running when we&#8217;re back.</p>



<p>Thursday was a public holiday in Iceland. It is the First Day of Summer. It seems an ironically early date for summer in Iceland, but when you remember that the year is only split into two seasons; winter and summer, not the four that more mid-latitude countries have, it makes sense. We took the opportunity to close-up the office until week #691 and use this and the May 1st bank holidays to travel.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #690</h2>



<p>This week was spent traveling and client work was put on hold. We did get to see and interact with a bunch of interesting exhibitions and technologies. For instance, RFID/NFC cards that were used to access doors, activate drinking fountains, access tickets and a login token to continue your progress from station to station. Lot of ideas are rattling around. This simple, cheap, unique identifier tokens are a great alternative to requiring a smart phone.</p>



<p>We played with an exhibition that 3D scans your LEGO creation, then injects it into a top-down driving video games. It was a lot of fun to watch and see. Designing a physical museum piece that will be used by lots and lots of people repeatedly is harder than doing it in software! Physical things wear down and break, digital bits are more resilient and easier to change.</p>

<figcaption>Collage of images of the LEGO car 3D scanner and the projected video game the car was put into.</figcaption>
</figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #691</h2>



<p>This week we&#8217;re back in the office picking-up on client tasks right where we left-off. We have around 10 projects on the go at the moment. Each is in various forms of &#8220;completion&#8221;. Our spring surveys are wrapped-up, we just need to do some final reporting of the data. Some new projects have been prototyped, others are still drafts. Others are longer and will be ongoing for awhile.</p>



<p>On Monday, we had a meeting with an Australian company about some data conversion. They use a proprietary legacy system from their supplier, but want to get their monthly P&amp;L into <a href="https://www.fathomhq.com">Fathom</a> to do better reporting. We&#8217;re tasked with a &#8216;data bridge&#8217; to aid in the conversions when there is no easy API integration. On Friday, we got the green-light to start building. This is a small-ish project to build, but will take awhile to get the edge-cases worked out.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, we closed another project with a company in Miami, Florida USA. We are starting with a prototype. They have a design partner lined-up which will give great feedback. Our task is to get the backend web service setup, the SwiftUI iOS app and the corresponding APIs. Someone else will be working on the Android version, based on our code.</p>



<p>Through-out the week, we continue to work on our internal project with some old co-workers. It is really taking shape and we managed to pitch it a bit more internally. That amounted to a few long conversations and yet another idea! (The domain has already been registered!)</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bric-à-brac</h2>



<p>Since our last update, we were listening to a podcast interview with <a href="https://benwillbond.com">Ben Willbond</a>. He&#8217;s probably best known for acting in the UK TV series <em>Ghosts</em> or <em>Horrible Histories</em>. In the interview, there was a throw-away comment about the Edinburgh Fringe festival where he and Arn Widdowson appeared as a French rap, pop and rock parody duo, <em>Priorité à Gauche</em>. That would normally not be anything special, except that back in 02003, we saw them perform at the Edinburgh Fringe! (Although at the time, it was probably Justin McCarron instead of Ben Willbond) It was a VERY memorable show we still think about today!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This was a double weeknote with a lot  of task juggling. On any given day, we'd touch 3-4 different client projects. It was fun, but exhausting.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #687</h2>



<p>We started the week with a few potentially new projects down-under in Australia. Most of these projects fall into custom software development: Data Bridge category. Companies have data in one silo and need to get it into another. For example, exporting data from an inventory system and bring it into a packaging software. APIs to export, massage that data into a new format, and APIs (hopefully) to import it into something else. Software Plumbers at your service.</p>



<p>Wednesday morning, we met-up with some other seasoned VR folks and had a chat about what&#8217;s up, what new and what everyone&#8217;s looking forward too. It&#8217;s great to get a lay of the land from out-side your own bubble and to mingle a bit more to let people know what we&#8217;re up too.</p>



<p>On Thursday, we sent our <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/02024Q2/">◍ Quarternotes 02024Q2 newsletter</a>. This is our quarterly newsletter covering some of the happenings in the company along with some interesting links.</p>



<p>We ended the week with two interesting project meetings. The first was like a phoenix rising from the ashes of a defunct project that crashed and burned a few months prior. Some of the team have dusted themselves of, and started again and want our help. This was a great first-meeting and we&#8217;re excited to work on the project.</p>



<p>The second meeting was even more interesting and top-secret. The first 5 minutes to a swerve we weren&#8217;t expecting with a crazy potential new project, but the pendulum swung back to the tasks at hand. It was great to meet Walid and his team. What we proposed as the software solution is a pretty &#8220;quick win&#8221; and we&#8217;re itching to get started. At some point, we should convince the client to spend less time in meetings and use those hours to explore in prototyping. We&#8217;re nearly there.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #688</h2>



<p>On Monday, we did the swap-over dance with one of our surveys. This is the last month of big survey work in the spring time. Things are going smoothly as we continue to email, sms and call participants.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, we sent out the <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/s03e04/">⪮ Good Morning s03e04 newsletter</a>. This is our growing newsletter that covers just 4-topic each episode, no self-promotion.</p>



<p>As we near the end of island.is (Iceland&#8217;s Single Sign On Service) for non-governmental agencies, we&#8217;re moving to TOTP (Timed-Based One-Time Passwords) from a QR code into some Authenticator app. Most of our customers are not expected to be so technical that they will already have an app. That means some very verbose, clear instructions on how to set this up.</p>



<p>The last two weeks we&#8217;ve ramped-up our free time on a quazi internal project: <em>Q-Arriba</em>. We&#8217;re very happy how well and fast it has come along. I guess that&#8217;s what years of experience gets you. You get to skip all the previous mistakes and get straight into the harder stuff.</p>



<p>On Friday, we had our fortnightly PETALS sync. We have our first external customer onboarded and will use it with their team and send some feedback. This is a big step, because previously we could break things and no one would notice, now we&#8217;ve gotten get much more professional in our deployments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fluxcapacitor</h2>



<p>It is fascinating to look back at <a href="https://optional.is/required/2018/04/20/week-375/">a weeknote from 6 years ago</a>. Some of the comments feels like yesterday, others feel like a world away, yet they happened in the same week.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A triple weeknote because of the Easter holidays and GDC travel.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #684</h2>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/IR_SF.jpg" alt="The San Francisco skyline through an Infrared filter." />
<figcaption>The San Francisco skyline through an Infrared filter.</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>This week was spent in San Francisco. It is the annual Game Developers Conference (GDC) and we went to have some meetings. It was pretty productive. The team was all in one place, we met with folks, discussed about past projects (what went well and not so well) and did some planning and prepping for future projects.</p>



<p>Overall, we&#8217;re getting aligned and heading in the right direction.</p>



<p>In San Francisco, we got to play with the new Apple Vision Pro. It is a very interesting object. For all its faults, spatial computing is a very interesting topic and for the first time in 50+ years it feels like we&#8217;ve properly broken away from the flat screen.</p>



<p>In SF, we also spotted some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waymo">Waymo self-driving cars</a>. We stopped to watch as it double-parked, turned on a small spotlight and waited for its passengers. It was an interesting UX experience. Later, we saw another car roll through the intersection and stop to pick someone up. An old lady crossing the street did a double-take when she realized no one was in the car!</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/lamy.jpg" alt="Lamy Joy Calligraphy fountain pen."/>
<figcaption>Lamy Joy Calligraphy fountain pen.</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>We also made it to the Lamy Flagship Store. We picked-up a Lamy Joy calligraphy pen. We don&#8217;t get to &#8216;doodle&#8217; on paper enough and hopefully this will help-us break into the habit again!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #685</h2>



<p>This week is Easter week. In Iceland, there are a lot of public holidays, schools are closed and shops change their hours. We already know it won&#8217;t be a very productive week, but that&#8217;s good since we have a massive backlog from being away the week before.</p>



<p>In week #686, we will start two more surveys. We&#8217;ve been doing some prep work so that is as smooth as possible, but our contact is out this week, so we need to wait until atleast Tuesday to get the green-light to start.</p>



<p>We also had a potential project meeting this week. The plan was to gather hourly estimates, workload and status to put together a grant proposal around adaptive podcasting. There is a June deadline, so we&#8217;re in a good place to figure everything out and draft something. This is a project that is completely out of our hands, we&#8217;re supporting, not leading. It will probably late June/July before we know if this has funding.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #686</h2>



<p>Monday was a public holiday in Iceland, Easter Monday. We still need to get five days worth of work done, now in just four days.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, we started two more big surveys. It is always stressful because there are endless last-minute, last changes. Like: <em>Did you remember todo that thing I never told you about until just now?</em> Which means shuffling things around to accommodate for changes. </p>



<p>None are impossible, just unexpected, untimely and under-appreciated. The surveys went out and results are slowly rolling in. We have our reminders schedule in place and over the next few weeks we&#8217;ll be emailing, SMSing, robocalling and more to get the response ratio to an acceptable level for statistically reliable results.</p>



<p>We continue to explore the ᯅ Vision Pro for few potential projects. We ported over two of our apps: Red Days and Emoji Calendar to go through the steps. This way we work out all the issues and kinks before any deadlines.</p>



<p>For another analytics project, we collecting event data. Every day as a scheduled job, we convert the data into intermediate tables. Then we can query those tables directly, or make further derived tables. We finally hit a wall and needed to optimize things a bit more. One table has grown to around 7M rows and the joins are taking way too long. We spent a few days this week making some intermediate tables and back filling them with all the derived data. Then updating queries to use these tables instead. It&#8217;s not perfect, but it will speed things up and for a tiny bit of potentially incorrect data, it will be OK. Previously, we could get <code>COUNT(distinct id)</code> but since we&#8217;ll split this up into months, we will get <code>COUNT(distinct id)</code> per month and summing the 12 months together means we could be counting distinct ids multiple times. It is a small trade-off for increased speed.</p>



<p>On Friday, we had our fortnightly PETALS sync. We didn&#8217;t get that much done, but atleast we got a big jump on some better CSS layouts for desktop browsers. I think we&#8217;re now ready to get more people onboard testing.</p>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f47b.png" alt="👻" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f47b.png" alt="👻" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <strong>Two ghosts came back to haunt us this week! </strong></p>



<p>One project we build, finished and they signed-off on months and month ago has thrown-up a bug. We fixed it since it was something tiny, but we&#8217;re sub-contractors for someone else and we&#8217;ve asked them awhile back to check and test with the customer and at the time we got the A-OK. But we&#8217;re pretty sure they never touched it until now. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f926-1f3fb-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="🤦🏻‍♂️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>The other project <em>(first deployed in 02016 and the last commit was from 02021-07)</em> uses Iceland&#8217;s single sign-on service, island.is which is being deprecated to the general public this September. We drafted an email a while ago about how we should backup and shut this project down since they haven&#8217;t done anything with it since COVID and the alternative to island.is doesn&#8217;t quite fulfill their contractual obligations. Before we had the free time and mental space to send it off and field the discussion, we got an email from them saying they are restarting the service. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f926-1f3fb-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="🤦🏻‍♂️" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><strong>This week was five days of firefighting.</strong><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f525.png" alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> No matter where we looked, we always got pulled into some issue(s) that needed fixing. Hopefully, most of that is behind us and the next two weeks we can move forward again.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fluxcapacitor</h2>



<p>April 1st, 02009, we wrote the first article <a href="https://optional.is/required/2009/04/01/phase-transition/">Phase Transition</a>. This is the point at which something changes from one form to another. From steam to water or water to ice. This is the boundary of change and it was fitting that it was our first post.</p>



<p>In 02011, we were ask our <a href="https://optional.is/required/2011/04/06/02011-predictions/">tech predictions by B!T Magazine in Portugal</a>. It is interesting to see what and how we explain our thoughts on what&#8217;s coming. It was a safe bet about existing technologies filtering more into daily life.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bric-à-brac</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Amazon Fresh &#8220;Just Walk Out&#8221;</h3>



<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazon-reportedly-ditches-just-walk-out-grocery-stores-1851381116">A Gizmodo article about how Amazon <s>tricked</s> lied about their AI system</a> to identify the items you put into your cart in their checkout-less store. The first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Go">Amazon Go</a> store was started in December 02016 as a beta for employees and was rolled out to everyone a few months later.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/introducing-the-first-amazon-fresh-grocery-store">August 27th 02020, Amazon announced the opening of their first &#8220;Amazon Fresh&#8221; store</a>.</p>



<blockquote>Customers simply place their bags in the cart, sign in using their Fresh QR code in the Amazon app, shop, and exit through the Dash Cart lane to automatically complete their payment. The cart uses a combination of computer vision algorithms and sensor fusion to identify items put in the cart.</blockquote>



<p>It turns out that their &#8220;Computer vision algorithms&#8221; were 1,000 workers in India watching you shop. Artificial-Artificial Intelligence. It was all snake oil and they&#8217;re shutting it down because it didn&#8217;t work or wasn&#8217;t cost effective. Instead of bringing human cashiers back into the mix, you&#8217;ll do all the work yourself. They first shifted the work to India, now they outsource it to you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Dark Star</h3>



<p>The BBC had an article about how the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20240403-dark-star-at-50-how-a-micro-budget-student-film-changed-sci-fi-forever">01970s SciFi thriller, Dark Star, impacted future movies</a>. As a student film with a budget of only $60,000 it is still going strong 50 years later!</p>



<p>Back in 02011, we went to someone&#8217;s random apartment and sat in their living room and watched a puppet show recreation of Dark Star. If it wasn&#8217;t recorded, no one would believe it happened!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A double weeknote covering a few meetings, potential projects and surveys.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #682</h2>



<p>This week we started yet another survey. This month it is our staff survey. Given it is a shorter month due the last week in March being Easter, we needed to be on top of starting on time and keeping-up our communications. This ensures we have a quality response rate and less work towards the end of the collection timeframe.</p>



<p>We also wrapped-up all our accounting tasks and closed the annual report for 02023. We sent all the info in to the tax man and we&#8217;ll wait and see. It is a never ending cycle, as we finish one year, we&#8217;re already a few months into the next.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, we met some folks for a morning meeting. There was no agenda, we were just recommended to meet-up since we have both been working on interesting projects. Maybe something will come out of it. Time will tell, but it is good to network and let others know we exist.</p>



<p>We also started tinkering on a new project with previous co-workers <em>(insert cool code name here that we&#8217;ll need to remember in a few years when we look back at this article)</em>, which is like an old project we all worked on. In the intervening few years, the tech stack has changed, needs have changed and so have revenue models. We think that a lot of our past experience is still relevant, so we&#8217;re building on those ideas for a new project.</p>



<p>On Friday, we had our fortnightly PETALS sync. We went over the product and continue to spot small things here and there. We made some tickets to improve the design and layout, but also as we&#8217;ve been dog-fooding this ourselves, we realize screens which should be intended to be shown to the team, had personal data on them. This isn&#8217;t a technical bug, but something that needs to be addressed in UX. We made some tasks and will continue to iterate.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #683</h2>



<p>Two potential new projects have bloomed this week. We had a meeting about one project focusing on podcasting. This is part of a grant proposal, so the work will only happen if/when it gets approved. The other project is a prototype project that we started a few weeks ago when we explored webRTC. Since that all seemed viable we came back to the client and had some more meetings and put together a pitch and timeline of &#8220;what 1 months worth of work will cost and what can we do to (in)validate this idea?&#8221;</p>



<p>On Wednesday we sent out our <a href="s03e03/">s03e03 ⪮ Good Morning Newsletter: Martian News</a>. We continue to send out a monthly email with just four interesting topics and a bit of commentary. Most recently, it has been clumping around a single concept.</p>



<p>On Sunday, we are heading off to San Francisco for the Game Developers Conference. We will mostly have meetings and team planning. Everyone will be in town that week and focused on gaming, so it makes sense to line-up as much as we can in that single week to keep up going for the next 12 months. There&#8217;s a lot of exciting things in the queue, it&#8217;s just a matter of seeing who&#8217;s interested and what happens next.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fluxcapacitor</h2>



<p>Back in 02014, we republished a long gone article from 02007 called <a href="https://optional.is/required/2014/03/11/in-rainbows/">In Rainbows</a>. This described an algorithm to consistently convert a string to a color. Originally used by the travel social service Dopplr, we&#8217;ve seen repurposed this on many an occasion.</p>



<p>In 02015, we wrote about <a href="https://optional.is/required/2015/03/11/schelling-points/">Shelling Points</a>. These are place solutions that people will tend to use in the absence of communication, because it seems natural, special, or relevant to them. We also speculate about whether animals have Shelling Points or if such things existing in outer space?</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A busy double weeknote. Lots of new, small projects all coming in at the same time.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Experience it 3 times, once when it happens, again when you write it down, then a third time when you read it again. Sometimes we need to remind ourselves that these week notes are also a reminder of what we did when we look back in a few years time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #680</h2>



<p>On Monday, we had an <a href="https://unofficehours.com">Unoffice hours</a> time slot booked with the cryptic discussion topic of: <em>Let’s talk about what words should and shouldn’t be used.</em> This got our mind racing since we&#8217;ve been working on the dictionary work on SpellStruck. Was this a disgruntled player? Had we said something someone took offense too? It is interesting, like a horoscope or psychic medium, the messages are vague, but not so vague that you couldn&#8217;t apply them to something you&#8217;re thinking about. </p>



<p>Well, they never showed-up. We sent them an email with no reply. Maybe something happened, maybe they&#8217;ll reply and maybe we&#8217;ll reschedule. Time will tell &#8211; probably spam.</p>



<p>We also went down to the University of Reykjavik, where the staff in the bio-mechanical engineering department are helping us to test our prototype bike design.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/bikeson.jpg" alt="Profile photo of the ebike prototype"/></figure>



<p>We have some data from the tests, but need to do another round and investigate some other aspects.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, we published our <a href="https://optional.is/required/2024/02/20/02023-annual-report/">02023 Annual Report</a>. This is a high-level overview of where our time and money went. It is meant for others who are freelancing (or considering it) or running a small business to compare and contrast to see what goes into running a business. It&#8217;s easy to have an idea and follow your dream, but few realize how much time, effort and money is spent in the infrastructure portion of a business &#8211; taxes, salary, accounting, legal, office supplies and more.</p>



<p>We continue with two projects in Australia. The first is glueing two APIs together. That&#8217;s going well, we have a domain and hosting, now it is the workflow and what data they need out. The second is cleaning-up and adding more features to our web-interface over Xero accounting software. The company can login, see active jobs and archive them. When they do, it creates an email with all the P&amp;L info they need.</p>



<p>We have two on-going parent surveys which are well underway and in great shape. In March, we&#8217;ll start a staff survey. Easter is the last week of March, so we need to start on time and power through the first three weeks. This week we continue to collect lists and prep. We also will start a third parent survey at end of Feb which will also run in March. There is a little bit of work we need todo to prep for some longitudinal changes to better optimize the sampling methodology.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #681</h2>



<p>This week we wrapped-up two big parent surveys and got ready to start a third. We&#8217;re also planning on starting a staff survey in March. It&#8217;s in good shape, we just need a few more lists, but given Easter is at the end of March, we&#8217;re in a slightly compressed timeframe. We normally give a parent 10 days to answer before swapping, so 21-ish for a staff member is plenty &#8211; even if we loose a few days to a slow start.</p>



<p>On Monday, we had our fortnightly PETALS meeting. We are at the point where we go through the whole flow and find less and less bugs. Some small clean-up this week, then the plan is to get an external team using the system to get more feedback. It&#8217;s an exciting baby-step to making this more public and a proper product.</p>



<p>We sent off another print-on-demand project idea. We got the proofs back already and have handed a few out for people to test. This is a riff on a popular genre of word-puzzle game where you get a quote or phrase but all the letters have been replaced by numbers. Then the key gives you a few of the pairs and much like a sudoku, you need to figure out the rest through logic and trial and error. After the feedback we can tweak the difficulty a bit, find more phrases and iterate to something more public.</p>



<p>Our office space is slowly coming together. We moved to a new, larger room, but in the shuffle, it became a storage room and we&#8217;ve been Tetris&#8217;ing around it for a few months now. This week, we got the shelves assembled again and books have been organized. That got us another few square meters and we have managed to bounce back and forth to something that&#8217;s almost usable!</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">WebRTC</h3>



<p>The BIG project for last two weeks has been a project which requires video chat. Rather than re-invent the wheel, we implemented a WebRTC client on the web and in iOS. WebRTC is a bit like magic because it is built into modern browsers. You do a lot of voodoo to make two (or more) clients talk to each other, then once you&#8217;ve negotiated the streams, you basically point it at a &lt;video> element and it just works!</p>



<p>We found some python libraries and javascript examples along with the same for iOS. But the only part of the WebRTC spec that is designed is the peer-to-peer video connection. How you signal to each other is up to you and of course everyone does it differently!</p>



<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle">Robustness Principle</a> states: &#8220;be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept&#8221;.</p>



<p>The code now has lots of if type==&#8221;ICEcandidate&#8221; or type==&#8221;IceCandidate&#8221;&#8230; seems like every library does it slightly differently. This was the prototype to prove to the customer it is possible. Now, if they are interested, we can work with them to build out the bigger concept.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fluxcapacitor</h2>



<p>Back in 02019, we wrote our <a href="https://optional.is/required/2019/03/01/week-420/">#420 weeknote</a>. We were still deep in survey work at that time too! But we also mentioned the new &#8220;TV Game&#8221; Avo! Sadly, the game and studio PlayDeo no longer exist&#8230; probably because Apple hired away two of the three co-founders in 02022. It was a fun game. You can find plenty of walk-throughs up on YouTube.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bric-à-brac</h2>



<p>This week, a friend introduced us to the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@3Dbotmaker">3Dbotmaker</a>. They have die-cast car race tournaments. They commentate as if these were real sporting events with plenty of background, driver history and more.</p>



<p>Another VERY similar concept is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JellesMarbleRuns">Jelle&#8217;s Marble Run</a> channel. They have obstacle courses for marbles with plenty of teams and back stories. It&#8217;s fun to watch and you quickly get caught-up rooting for your favorite team.</p>



<p>Speaking of Marble runs, there are channels (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MrSticksman">Mr Sticksman</a>) using virtual marble run software to build massive obstacle courses. One of the interesting ones has a patreon where you can help support the channel. In return, one of the virtual marbles gets your name on it and you can watch and root for yourself. We think that&#8217;s a great idea, it is small effort for the creator, but a big, personal impact for the contributor. It is also virtual, so the cost to label the marble compared to what you can charge has a pretty high mark-up compared to making something physical and shipping it through the post.</p>
