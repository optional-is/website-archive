					<description><![CDATA[A double weeknote from the road. We moved the office to sunny Tenerife for two weeks for a much needed change of scenery.]]></description>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #751</h2>



<p>It was yet another short week because Friday was the <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f9e8.png" alt="🧨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f1fa-1f1f8.png" alt="🇺🇸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> 4th of July in the USA. That meant things were quiet for those projects and we could catch-up a bit on some Australia work.</p>



<p>We continue to work on the WebRTC project. This week was less about the actual WebRTC and instead just about a web socket to &#8216;broadcast&#8217; to the other attendees metadata info. Who&#8217;s muted, playback and timecode. This all works and is hooked-up to other events.</p>



<p>This week we relocated the office to the Canary Islands for some much needed sun. We took along the IR filter for the camera and have been taking some photos around town. The sun is VERY bright, so the IR is pretty intense. It also means a decent shutter speed compared to Iceland.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IR-tenerife.jpg" alt="Infrared images of palm trees" /></figure>



<p>The place we&#8217;re staying at does not have free WiFi. It doesn&#8217;t cost much, but it&#8217;s still an inconvenience and they meter it by the number of devices. We didn&#8217;t even consider this, so when we&#8217;re back at the main office, we&#8217;re going to do a few experiments. MacOS lets you share one connection via another. What you can&#8217;t do is share the same connection both incoming and outgoing. For instance, you can&#8217;t have all your devices connect to your laptop via the WiFi, then also use your laptop&#8217;s WiFi to connect to the internet. But if you have two WiFi adapters, then it&#8217;s possible. We&#8217;re sure in the bottom of some cable draw we have a $5 UBC-A WiFi adapter. We&#8217;ll test it at home and add that to the travel tech kit for the future!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #752</h2>



<p>After a review of the WebRTC project status, our next major focus will be to get it working on tvOS! The library we&#8217;re using is not built for tvOS by default, but it seems others have managed, so we&#8217;re following their steps in the hope we can get it to work. We broke it down into three main tasks, get the library compiling as is (done), then update the source and target tvOS, then update the tvOS app to look for an external continuity camera as the video source.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, we sent out our <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/02025Q3/">Q3 Quarternotes newsletter</a>. Annoyingly, this time, when we sent it, as it was going out, our bulk mail provider decided to rate limit us and dropped a bunch of messages. After the script finished, we had to go to their logs, find out who already received the message, and re-send the email (minus those who already got it) with a few seconds delay between each message. What should have been a quick task ate up most of the morning!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #749</h2>



<p>On Tuesday, Iceland celebrated National Day and Thursday was Juneteenth in the US. They were both public holidays chopping the week into three, one-day pieces. Projects were very stop and start, but we did make some progress. The WebRTC project hit another small milestone getting two apps to connect and conduct a video call. Now we&#8217;ve managed to get web-to-web, web-to-app, and app-to-app all communicating. Still lots of loose ends around multiple video participants, but progress is in the right direction.</p>



<p>Throughout the week, we&#8217;ve also been working on a project for the Australian concreters. We&#8217;ve had some minor web app improvements. Mostly quality of life stuff: better caching, color-coding table based on job type and improving permissions. We are also developing the web app further to handle another division in the company and its inventory management. It&#8217;s not a huge project, but not small either. We&#8217;re now at the point where a few decisions need to be made and we&#8217;ll have a late Sunday meeting to sync for the next week.</p>



<p>The procrastination on other tasks lead us to a productive Wednesday. Rather than do the tasks at hand, we took a break and went back to the survey projects. We have a list of summer tasks we want to look into, some small others large. We knocked out a few smaller ones; 2FA reset requests and a &#8216;welcome back info box&#8217; to confirm all the customer details at the start of the academic year. Next week the plan is to push the branches we&#8217;ve been working on to massively upgrade the software stack and dependencies. This will make maintenance and development easier, but also patch security issues and hopefully improve performance.</p>



<p>On Thursday, we met-up with a friend who&#8217;s also doing some VR work and other physical installation work and had a great long chat and catch-up. Even a few potential plans have emerged. Our main goal was to onboard him on an old VR project we built. Luckily it worked and went very smoothly!</p>



<p>On Friday, we published an article <a href="https://optional.is/required/2025/06/20/blind-men-and-the-elephant/">Blind Men and the Elephant</a>. We keep a close eye on technology and we&#8217;re always looking at new ways or lead indicators of where things are heading. Apple, Google, Meta, Samsung all have big product announcements. If you take all the pieces holistically and assume they are only a tiny part of something bigger, you begin to see companies developing the future in front of you without you even realizing it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #750</h2>



<p>We started the week off with our Australian concreters. The new inventory management system is taking shape. We have all the projects in the database with their inventory, projected usage, restock dates to help maintain some JIT (Just-in-time) delivery. The next big task is to get this data entered and map for actual job instances.</p>



<p>For our survey system, we&#8217;ve been upgrading all the libraries and generally brining everything up to the latest stable versions. In the process we&#8217;re dumping old code, reviewing login flows and fixing a few old bugs in the process. Once we merge the branch back into main, we&#8217;ll start the next task to update the themes to accommodate better readability fonts and colors, dark mode, and more modern CSS.</p>



<p>Thursday we spent out of the office down at the local co-working space. There was a lunchtime presentation by an AI company and most people left. We also managed to get a bunch of writing done and planning the publishing schedule for Q3.</p>



<p>For the next two weeks, we&#8217;re closing the office (mostly). Next week, the Q3 newsletter is queued-up and we&#8217;ll have another double weeknote highlighting our time off (we hope).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bric-à-brac</h2>



<p>We went down the rabbit hole of old Light Guns and how CRT monitors had incredible refresh rates compared to modern LCDs. In the Nintendo museum in Kyoto, there is a Zapper and Scope exhibition and it is interesting learn how they managed to bring this 40 year old tech up to modern day.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="How the Nintendo Zapper worked in Slow Motion - The Slow Mo Guys" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V6XnSvB34y8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The slow-mo guys explain how the Zapper gun works. The gun is the receiver and the TV produces all black frames and frames where a white box represents a hit. The receiver then registers what it saw and that in turn was a hit or a miss.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A quick double weeknote: Mostly WebRTC, planning, WWDC and reacting.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #747</h2>



<p>We continue to take small bits out of our WebRTC project. The libraries and sample code out there are all written in swift using UIKit. We have gone all in for SwiftUI, which is swift, but not the normal app life-cycle. We ported the sample code from Swift UIKit to SwiftUI and managed to get everything talking between the app and web. Baby steps.</p>



<p>The whole week, we did some prep work on a pitch meeting on Friday. The meeting was focused on something else, but we needed a plan B incase the audience wasn&#8217;t interested. Luckily, they were, and after a 2h meeting, our Plan B never got mentioned. It&#8217;s always a bit of a downer after you rush to put in a bunch of work to not even get it shown, but it&#8217;s not wasted effort. Once the dust settles a bit, we&#8217;ve got a really good prototype and deck ready to go at a moments notice.</p>



<p>On Friday, we published our article <a href="https://optional.is/required/2025/06/06/disney-flowchart/">Disney Flowchart</a>. Back in 01957, Walt Disney created a flow chart to better explain how all the different parts of his company interacted. We have thought about what our version of this flow chart would be, and how we can use it to identify places for improvement and things to watch out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #748</h2>



<p>Monday was a public holiday in Iceland. It was also Apple&#8217;s annual WWDC (World Wide Developer Conference). We have several projects using Apple&#8217;s tech, so we kept an eye on what&#8217;s new. The biggest change is this Liquid Glass theme for all the OS 26 versions. We&#8217;ll see how it pans out through all the betas.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, Salesforce and Heroku had a major outage. We use Heroku for lots of projects and for some projects the sites were down, others were up but we couldn&#8217;t deploy. It took over 8 hours for them to resolve the problems. Luckily for us, our surveys are done for the year and other projects in Australia were down mostly through their evening. </p>



<p>We continue to work on our WebRTC project. We have web-to-web video working, we also have app-to-web working, and app-to-app is nearly there. The next big tasks are to get it for more than just two participants via an app, starting to style it, get can video playback working, and the biggest task to get it working on tvOS. Out-of-the-box, this isn&#8217;t possible, but some people have managed it. But that&#8217;s a later task.</p>



<p>This week was full of meetings. Some Calendar UI/UX planning, PETALS planning, project feedback and more. It makes getting work done a bit harder when you&#8217;re stopping and starting for meetings, but they are a necessary evil to move some things ahead.</p>



<p>Finally, we watch as the US dollar (USD) to the Icelandic Kronur (ISK) continues to sink! At its peak in Mid-February, it was 142 ISK to the Dollar. This week it was down to 123 ISK. <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/yearly-average-currency-exchange-rates">According to the US IRS</a>, the average USD-&gt;ISK for 02024 &amp; 02023 was a shade under 138. That means our invoices are worth 11% less than previous years, coupled with a 10% inflation in Iceland, these US jobs either need a drastic increase in the rates or de-prioritized.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #745</h2>



<p>Wrangling tvOS is a pain. Given the user input it not touch it has some strange default behaviors. They are nothing that can&#8217;t be fixed, but it&#8217;s good to try and develop in tandem with iOS so you can fix both as you go along and built it &#8216;right&#8217; from the start. on tvOS buttons and lists all require special love and care to get the default interactions and focus.</p>



<p>This week we went down a big rabbit hole over Apple Game Center achievements. We setup a way to reward achievements using the App Store Connect API outside of the app. There are two main reasons for this: We&#8217;ve added some new achievements which are unreachable if you&#8217;re an older player. Our new script is a way to backfill some of that data. The other reasons revolve around achievements that are not tied to the game. We have some ideas around interesting things we can do, but we&#8217;ll wait and see if it is worth the effort (or even allowed).</p>



<p>On Thursday we published an article about our <a href="https://optional.is/required/2025/05/22/ornithoto-camera-app/">new iPhone camera app: Ornithoto</a>. This is a bit of a deeper explanation of the app, it&#8217;s inspiration, some technical aspects and more. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ornithoto/id1665382610?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Ornithoto is available on the Apple App Store</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Backups</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<blockquote>You don&#8217;t have a back-up until you restore!</blockquote>
</blockquote>



<p>A wise man who works in operations once told us: You don&#8217;t have a back-up until you restore. It made sense at the time, but who ever really restores from a backup as a test? On a personal machine, you need to get work done and its expense to have a second machine just to test your backups, so no one does. Our backup regime is pretty good. We have an air-gapped external hard drive we backup too monthly, we have daily Time Machine backups and those are copied offsite. This week, something happened to the local TimeMachine hard drive. Some bits got crossed and the local backups needed to be purged. Nothing to worry about, we still have the data in 3 place (on the device, the slightly out-of-date air-gap external drive, and the remote backup). As a test, we decided to copy the remote backups locally again and continue from there. After a few days of waiting to rsync the data back, the .sparsebundle backups didn&#8217;t work. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f62c.png" alt="😬" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>This was good to find out. We needed to figure out if the remote backup files corrupt or were they borked when trying copy them locally again? How can we prevent this from happening? Either way, we started fresh now and got the local backups going again and sync them remotely.</p>



<p>After doing some homework, it turns out that we were using the <code>--ignore-existing</code> flag with rsync. We (wrongly) assumed that if the file already existed (and was the same) it would skip it. What that parameter actually does is ignore all checks if the file already is there, in any shape or form, and it skips it. That meant our updated files and incremental backups were never updating!</p>



<p>As annoying as this is, we&#8217;re not stressed (yet), because this only affected the remote backups. It&#8217;s best to find these things under happy times rather than in a stressful situation! </p>



<p><strong>It&#8217;s true that you never have a backup until you restore it!</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #746</h2>



<p>This was a short week. Monday was a public holiday in the USA. Thursday was a public holiday in Iceland and then lots of places were closed on Friday to make a long weekend. </p>



<p>This week we continued working on some WebRTC stuff. Getting it to work on tvOS is going to prove a bit trickier. The library I found does not natively work on tvOS, but some people have managed to make some changes and get it to work, so we&#8217;re positive. Out tests with demo apps we&#8217;ve built from source code do work, now it&#8217;s getting that into our prototypes.</p>



<p>On another web project, we&#8217;ve been contemplating giving things a fresh look. That will require us to revisit our CSS workflow. Right now we have a small script that runs when we commit our code into the repo. It builds the SASS files into CSS and combines and compresses our Javascript and CSS files as needed. It&#8217;s a very old workflow that is over-engineered for our needs. This summer we&#8217;ll revisit all of this, but for now, we&#8217;re making a plan. This will simplify the CSS, get us a dark mode, modernize the code with variables and in general get rid of a bunch of cruft.</p>



<p>For our tablet/VR project, we&#8217;re now getting to the part that&#8217;s less about the customer facing product and more about the user permissions for the client&#8217;s team. We&#8217;ve been building a permission system for the editors who will log into the Web Admin tool to manage assets. Now we&#8217;re changing to the permission system of those who can log into the actual customer app. Those permissions are completely different. They are read-only on a page-by-page level. Then we need to think of parent and children pages as well and what permissions are inherited.</p>



<p>In preparation for meetings in June, we&#8217;re putting together some prototype updates and a slide deck for a smaller side project. It won&#8217;t be the focus of the meeting, but certainly an extra at the end, or if the main project gets zero traction in the meeting, we have a plan B.</p>



<p>Finally, on Sunday night (which is Monday morning in Australia) we have a call for another project kick-off. This one is with an existing client who&#8217;s looking to expand their business into new product which means and update to their web app job and inventory tracking system we built.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A double weeknote covering lots of projects, some admin, and chasing a few leads.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #743</h2>



<p>On Thursday we pushed a big update to the <a href="https://petals.team">PETALS</a> app. Of course there were a few minor deploy hiccups. Something todo with minor changes between the settings on the DEV server compared to the PROD server cause some HTTPS infinite redirects. </p>



<p>On the VR/Tablet front, we&#8217;ve continued to work on some permissions on the web admin tool to manage content. We&#8217;ve also been exploring porting some experimental code to view stereoscopic 360 images in to the VR app.</p>



<p>On our join Calendar redesign project, we worked on converting some Figma sketches into responsive HTML. The original design was great for a single event and countdown. We took that design and made a compact view that displayed 4-5 countdowns in the same space.</p>



<p>One project from Australia needed some minor tweaking. We&#8217;ve built several systems now for various companies to help them with logging worker&#8217;s time to projects and pushing those timesheets into their accounting software Xero. This small tweak was to track jobs as contracted and alert them to invoice them accordingly.</p>



<p>The WebRTC continues to move forward. We&#8217;ve refactored a lot of code to make sure it is all working on the web with multiple participants. We&#8217;re now looping back to the code to make sure it can also work on iOS (android later, but WebRTC is an open standard so we&#8217;re not too worried)</p>



<p>For some projects we introduced a QR code TOTP for two-factor authentication. We moved this direction since island.is closed their SSO for non-governmental organizations. Instead of paying the fees for other services, we copied the University of Iceland and recommend an authenticator app. That has worked well, but some of our customers manage to delete the entry, never save it, can&#8217;t find it, or change devices. So we have no way to reset the 2FA except to call us. Our goal this summer is to replace that with an SMS reset. Request a reset, get an SMS with a code to a number you have on file, use that to login instead, then re-setup the 2FA.</p>



<p>We also soft launched our <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ornithoto/id1665382610?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Ornithoto app for the iPhone</a>. This is a camera all that takes long exposures by using different blend modes between video frames to create a single image. We recommend you download it now, even if you aren&#8217;t planning on using it. In a few months we&#8217;ll set a price on the download, but if you download it now, all future updates will be free.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #744</h2>



<p>There are two potential new Australian projects. The first is a rather large on to help inventory management, installation teams and more is on hold until the &#8216;actual&#8217; workflow is hammered out to a repeatable process that we can convert into some web-based forms.</p>



<p>There was a bunch of iOS dev work on various projects. After soft-launching we got lots of little feedback about the Ornithoto app. We made some bug fixes, lowered the required OS version and made some UX improvements.</p>



<p>For a friend, we&#8217;ve been building a small data tracker. In the past she&#8217;d used several different apps to track a medical condition, medication and other health metrics. Sadly, these apps keep going offline or are region locked. Off-and-on, we&#8217;ve been building a simple tool for her to collect, record and visualize the data on a calendar view (and maybe more in the future). Since it is a not a public projects associated with a company, ironically, it might have a longer life-span than others.</p>



<p>We continued with the WebRTC project. We didn&#8217;t manage to get the iOS WebRTC libraries integrated yet, but we did manage to bring the iOS and tvOS apps (mostly) up to parity with the web. Almost all the features of the web are not APIs to the apps. The tvOS app needed a bunch of button refactoring since moving focus on a screen with a remote is very different than direct touch input.</p>



<p>Our bi-monthly VAT was due for March/April. We use a service called <a href="https://payday.is">PayDay.is</a> which managed all the invoicing, expenses and payroll, so the VAT reports are usually just us quickly reviewing to make sure we didn&#8217;t forget to add any recipes and pressing send.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bric-à-brac</h2>



<p>Something in our heads this week made this bubble up: SEGA&#8217;s mid-90s &#8220;WELCOME TO THE NEXT LEVEL&#8221; marketing campaign.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A double weeknote full of public holidays, but we kept truckin' through it all to make lots of progress on tasks.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #741</h2>



<p>This week we put the final touches on our two iOS Camera Apps. That&#8217;s a bigger write-up in itself, but we did all the boring plumbing of making keywords and screenshots for the App Store. One has been approved the other is in the process. They&#8217;ll be ready soon-ish for anyone to download for free, then we&#8217;ll add a price.</p>



<p>The local mastodon instance (lodfill.is) is closing down. It was too big of a project with too much cost for the owner. We&#8217;ve contemplated creating our own instance, but we&#8217;d probably fall into many of those same traps. Instead, we made the move over to mastodon.social. We figured that will probably remain online longer and if for some reason we need to move again, so be it. All of our followers SHOULD have been migrated over, but incase not, or you&#8217;re a new follower, you can join us: <a href="https://mastodon.social/@briansuda">@briansuda@mastodon.social</a></p>



<p>A friend-of-a-friend who has fed us projects in the past has a new potential project on the horizon. The timing didn&#8217;t work out to have a face-to-face meeting last week, but hopefully we can schedule something virtually. Then see if this project has any legs and is worth working on.</p>



<p>For one project we&#8217;ve been doing a lot of tablet and VR development. One big issue everyone complains about is the setup process with the new Apple Vision Pro. The device is really designed for a single person. When you give it to someone else, it needs to be in guest mode, they need to do the eye and hand calibration, etc. It&#8217;s a pain every time! This week we were watching a YouTube video about creative storytelling and video production for the Vision Pro (for yet another potential project). One develop complained about the same issue: the constant setup. They he said, &#8220;To solve that we created our own app&#8221;. We froze and rewound the video! After going deep, we now know how to get the Apple Vision Pro into &#8220;Kiosk mode&#8221; which means only a single app runs and there is no setup between users! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f389.png" alt="🎉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f973.png" alt="🥳" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>We started a new project at the beginning of April. For the first three-weeks of development (not man weeks) we setup all the &#8220;plumbing&#8221; needed to get to this point. We stubbed out a website, an app, create the models, setup all the connections, zing emails back and forth when things happen and more. Now that that&#8217;s all done, we&#8217;re focusing on the &#8220;meat and potatoes&#8221; and doing deep now on WebRTC.</p>



<p>Thursday was the First Day of Summer here in Iceland. That&#8217;s a public holiday here, so the day was a mix of wandering around town like everyone else and enjoying the weather, while still having a few international meetings. The old Icelandic calendar, misseristal, was split into two seasons: Winter and Summer. Each month had 30 days with a 364 days calendar. So every Thursday in late April is the first day of Harpa, the start of the summer season.</p>



<p>On Friday, we had an UnOffice Hours Meeting. It is always great to meet new people. We exchanged some book ideas, a good chat and more. If you want to book checkout: <a href="https://unofficehours.com">https://unofficehours.com</a></p>



<p>We also published an article called <a href="https://optional.is/required/2025/04/25/muscle-flexes/">Muscle Flexes</a>. WAY back in 02011, we were at an event and the late David Carr mentioned thinking about things like &#8220;going to the gym&#8221;. You&#8217;re always crap and don&#8217;t want to go back a second time, but if you do, you&#8217;ll only improve. He took that approach to video blogging and more with success. It&#8217;s always stuck with us, so it was finally time to publish something about it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #742</h2>



<p>We rebuilt the WebRTC clients this week. We previously ran a small spike to make sure what we wanted todo could be done. We confirmed that late last year. Now, it is time to rework the code into something that&#8217;s fit for our web app. This includes knowing who the person is based on their login and what group they are trying to communicate with. Our first attempt at porting the code over to using the authenticated users half-worked, but after going through line-by-line comparing it to the older working code, we got everything up-and-running in Safari, Chrome and Firefox. Now we can start to add all the extra quality-of-life features: Admin muting and booting, private groups, additional media for all participants, etc.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, we had a meeting about a big change to an existing product. Previously, we built a tablet and VR app for a customer to demo some of their products. There has always been a simple share feature using the built-in OS share sheets. They now want to take that a step further and send an email with a custom link to browse the &#8216;favorited&#8217; projects online. This is the start of feeding the data into our customers&#8217; CRM tool.</p>



<p>There are now two projects percolating in Australia for us to work on. Our contact is getting all the details and scope of the project before they bring it to us and we get down-and-dirty with estimates, timelines, technologies and more.</p>



<p>Thursday was the May 1st Bank Holiday here in Iceland. Of course the US doesn&#8217;t celebrate May Day, they have Labor Day in August, and the UK moved the holiday to Monday May 5th!</p>



<p>Friday our hope was to play some catch-up on tasks, but we got hit with 5+ meetings. Luckily, this post was already queued-up, because the electrician also decided today was a good day to finish all his tasks. Needless to say, we got lots done, but not the stuff that needed to be done. (Now Monday next week is looking pretty busy!)</p>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f382.png" alt="🎂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> On May 4th, (optional.is) ehf. will technically be 4 years old. In 02021, we converted the company from an SLF to an EHF &#8211; resetting the company id. The SLF was incorporated in 02011, but the domain has been active since 02009. Depending on how you look at it, the company is 4, 14, or 16 years old.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A double weeknote as we head into Easter. The weeks were full of unexpected diversions, but they are leading in interesting directions.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #739</h2>



<p>Last Friday, on the 5th anniversary of John Conway&#8217;s passing, we posted about <a href="https://optional.is/required/2025/04/11/cellular-automata/">Cellular Automata</a>. It an algorithm near and dear to our hearts.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s funny how sometimes as simple off the cuff remark about an idea snowballs into something bigger. We&#8217;ve had an idea for a VR video and briefly pitched it in a meeting to feel out if this was even something the client would think was possible. They loved it and asked to see the proposal. We had to say it was nothing more than an idea. Within a few days they asked again for the proposal! When something like this lands, you take the chance. This week we started to storyboard the video. First with words and flow charts, then we moved to some sketches. Then we just opened-up iMovie and dropped in some clipart and stock images to start to get the timing and transitions. This &#8220;temp track&#8221; has worked well to start a conversation and see the weak parts of our story idea.</p>



<p>We took a diversion about got back into iOS development this week. We have one project which is going to rely heavily on some app technologies and we&#8217;re prototyping with web and iOS. While we were in Xcode we also started a new side-project with a friend to create a simple tracking app which combines a few different variables into as single interface.</p>



<p>For another project we&#8217;ve been using Zendesk to manage support requests. The volume of requests has massively dropped off as the project becomes more and more stable. The price of Zendesk was too much for what we needed, so this week we made the jump to Freshdesks. Luckily the REST APIs were pretty similar, so updating our backend was pretty minimal.</p>



<p>Peppered through out the week were plenty of small tasks. Both customers from Australia needed minor changes. A new link, a template tweak, etc. Nothing major or outrageous and all billable. It&#8217;s a good example of a typical week, some over-arching month long projects, interspersed with quick iterations, planing and pitches, mixed with fixing typos.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #740</h2>



<p>This week is Easter Week. In Iceland, there are several public holidays which make it a shorter week. We didn&#8217;t get much work done, but did book several meetings. </p>



<p>We had our fortnightly Calendar sync meeting on Wednesday. Things are looking really good and we can start to move into the next phase from Figma to something more programatic. We also have a longer project with weekly sync meetings. We take 15-30 minutes to talk with the client and explain what&#8217;s been done, what we plan on doing and help them with any next steps on their side.</p>



<p>On Thursday, we had our fortnightly PETALS sync. We&#8217;ve done several laps around this new design with a bit of new functionality. We&#8217;re a behind our self-imposed schedule, but not by much.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re on the home stretch with our surveys. We&#8217;ve published all the reports from March and cleaned-up and turned over the data for our private customer survey. In April we&#8217;re only surveying our regular monthly student survey and our twice-annual high-school survey. We were pretty aggressive with our reminder schedule to the high-school students because this week they were off and next week has two more public holidays! We&#8217;re almost through all the spring surveys.</p>



<p>As part of some of the downtime, we took the opportunity to migrate two of our iOS camera apps from the older Swift/Objective-C code to more SwiftUI. This will make things more flexible and cleaner going forward. We managed to get both in working order, fixed a few bugs and got more beta testers on newer devices to give it a try. The next steps will be to publish the apps on the App Store for anyone to buy.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A single weeknote to kickoff Q2! We've been busy in meetings, winding down surveys and starting a new prototype.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Right at the tail-end of last week, Iceland experienced a partial solar eclipse.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/cheese-grater-eclipse.jpg" alt="Shadow of a cheese grater with the pin holes showing the partial solar eclipse" />
<figcaption>NEVER stare at the Sun directly. During this partial solar eclipse  we made a pinhole camera with a cheese grater. The shadow of the holes show the transit of the moon.</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>On the 12th of August 2026 at 16:42, Iceland will experience a total solar eclipse. Things will go dark, assuming the weather is clear!</p>



<p>For our surveys, we have on stage of reminders being a robocall. We have an automated decision tree make a call-out and playback an mp3 file and allow participants to re-request their login code. Depending on the audience we try to find a sensible time to do the calling. If it is a staff survey, we can do it during business hours, but if it isn&#8217;t we want to avoid the normal 9-5, but also not be too late. Recently, we&#8217;ve been trying to call in the afternoons on the weekend to see how that affects the response rate.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, we sent out our <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/02025Q2/">Quarternotes Q2 newsletter</a>. If you&#8217;re not subscribed, we offer inbox delivery, RSS and an online version.</p>



<p>Q1 is over. There isn&#8217;t much administrative tasks when this happens, like the end of a fiscal year or when our VAT is due. But it is a good point to look back and reflect on what&#8217;s been happening. More and more, we&#8217;re wrestling with the fact that we&#8217;re super busy, but can&#8217;t really talk about any of the projects in detail (yet). Stretching out weeknotes and emails with vagueries about what we&#8217;ve been doing is getting a bit boring. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1fae0.png" alt="🫠" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>On Tuesday we also started the last of our surveys. In the background we have one running each month, but that runs like clockwork. These single month surveys tend to be bigger and more involved. We have many &#8220;touch points&#8221; with the participants: emails, sms, calls, etc. We&#8217;re in the final stretch of survey season for the school year.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, we had a kickoff meeting for another prototyping project. This one is around WebRTC and should last 3-4 months. We managed to spin-up our boilerplate Django app with authentication and some basic API work. Then a prototype iOS and tvOS app which has a login and connects to that API. That&#8217;s all working, now we can actually start to style it and get into the specific business logic.</p>



<p>We also meet-up with some friends to discuss more calendar workflow stuff. We&#8217;re all noodling on some new calendar UI/UX and it will be interesting to see where it goes.</p>



<p>On Thursday, we finally got the GDC debrief and loads of good news! A few of our goals can be ticked off and the ball is rolling to see where some of these ideas can go! (more on that later).</p>



<p>Friday was full of meetings. We had a PETALS sync to try and get the last items out the door to launch the new UI. Just needed to go over a few Pull Requests and get the testing working again locally. We also had a demo of another prototype game we&#8217;re involved with. This one is in Unity so we&#8217;re not directly contributing any code or design (yet).</p>



<p>This whole week, we&#8217;ve seen new tariffs, which don&#8217;t affect us directly in our products, and a dropping exchange rate. We&#8217;ve lost 8-10% of the value of our international invoices! Hopefully things will bounce back, or atleast level off. If things get worse, we need to re-evaluate a few projects on the horizon.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A double weeknote covering not going to GDC, but still having a bunch of meetings.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #736</h2>



<p>The week started out on the wrong foot! We have several surveys underway and as part of that we sent a lot of email reminders. These go both to the participants to nudge them to take the survey, but also to our customers updating them of the response rate, end date, etc. We started Monday by trying to send out some reminders, but our bulk mail provider was experiencing difficulties.</p>



<p>On Monday, we also had several requests from our Australian customers that needed to be squeezed into the weekly schedule. Nothing major, but tasks nonetheless.</p>



<p>This week is also GDC (Game Developers Conference) in San Francisco. The last few years we&#8217;ve been in attendance, less so for the conference and more so for meetings. This year, we&#8217;ve got things covered from afar. Projects are already brewing and it isn&#8217;t as important for us to be there in person.</p>



<p>On Thursday, we published our article <a href="https://optional.is/required/2025/03/20/eyjafjallajokull-15th-anniversary/">Eyjafjallajökull 15th Anniversary</a>. It was back on March 20th, 02010 that the world was turned upside down from the impending ash cloud!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #737</h2>



<p>On Monday we tried a new lunch time chat, hang out. There was no agenda, just a few friends going a video call and catching-up. We&#8217;ll try it again and expand the circle to a few more folks.</p>



<p>Tuesday, more survey stuff. We&#8217;re half way through one survey, so that means we swap around the guardians to now let the second, random guardian take part. With these most recent surveys we&#8217;re starting to hit more and more walls on performance. It feels like we haven&#8217;t change our code, but heroku is having some issues. It is hard to confirm, but in the meantime we&#8217;re going through the code and figuring out anything that is a performance hit and removing or optimizing it a bit more. We put in a support ticket and then had some database connection issues. Hopefully they can get to the bottom of all this, but I suspect their reply will be &#8220;We found nothing, it&#8217;s your problem&#8221;.</p>



<p>Meetings, meetings, meetings! It has been a very busy week for meetings. From afar, we&#8217;re feeding info to part of the team on the west coast as they meet with a bunch of our stakeholders as well as pitching a few potential projects. Locally, we&#8217;ve had lunch with some old colleagues who&#8217;ve made the jump to self-employment and some new arrivals to the country to chat about setting-up their own Icelandic company. Plus a new project kick-off meeting, a top secret meeting about new software features coming down the pipes so we can be ready, a few sync-up meetings and more!</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve also been eyeball-deep in 360 panoramic images. For the tablet and VR headset, we&#8217;re working with some architects to take their 3D renderings and put in a 360 camera to export images we can use in our apps. They look amazing and with more feedback, I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll do even more.</p>



<p>Over this weekend is when Europe jumps ahead for their &#8220;Daylight savings&#8221;. Which means a big shuffle for regularly, reoccurring meetings. Depending on who created the meeting it will either jump ahead an hour or not. We had this same jumble two weeks ago when the US jumped ahead, now Europe is catching-up and we&#8217;re stuck in the middle on perpetual UTC.</p>



<p>This is the last week in the quarter. We managed to stick to a weekly publishing schedule! For the first 13 weeks of the year we published either an article or a weeknote. Our goal is to keep this up in Q2. We already have a bunch of articles drafted, scheduled and ready to go!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A quick single weeknote so we can get a few other posts on track and realign our publishing schedule.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>For one of our projects, we&#8217;re working on some VR/AR experiences. As part of this, we are displaying 360 images &#8220;in the round&#8221;. As simple as they are, these images are easy to produce and very immersive! As a next step, our client asked to annotate parts of the image. The text can be baked into the image. Using an image editing software, it is possible to open the file, add another layer and type what is needed. The issue comes with the distortion. Luckily we&#8217;re mostly tracing with minimal text labels. As a first pass, it worked well.</p>



<p>For web-based projects, our goto stack is usually Django on Heroku. For a different client, they have so many entries that generating a table now times-out and throws and error. Heroku only lets you run a process for 30 seconds before it terminates, which is both good and bad. For us, it is time to refactor the code! Luckily, Django has Pagination built-in. We switched over to that with minimal changes and it works great. The downside now, is that we had client-side javascript filtering. It was much faster to use a regex on &lt;td&gt; values than to re-fetch any filtered data from the server. But, since we have now chunked the data into pages, the client-side filtering only works on the visible data, not all of it. You win some and you lose some. We&#8217;ll probably go back and increase the number of items on a page without timing out, but they will still have to filter manually over each page and combine any results manually.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, we had our fortnightly sync about some new calendaring ideas with a few friends. These are very loose, exploratory meetings. Once things are a bit more solid, we can show-off what we&#8217;ve been up too. This is a great example of having a product that scratches your own itch, no pressure deadlines and allows you to explore a bit more things we find interesting at our own pace with feedback from like-minded others.</p>



<p>On Thursday, we started yet another survey. We closed out all the February surveys last week, have an ongoing staff survey and now started a private parents survey. We&#8217;re very mindful that in one month we hit all the Easter holidays. That means we need to plan our communication cadence with the participants in a way that makes the best use of the time.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been dabbling with Apple&#8217;s SwiftUI programming language for projects. It is great, easy and quick if you want to replicate Apple style apps. If it is a native-looking list of items, you can knock that out in a very short amount of time! Luckily, those are the kinds of utility apps we like. This week, we explored more button styling to keep with all the native controls in SwiftUI, but break more out of the default look. As part of that, we explored adding sound effects and ambient music to the app. It turns out that the playback isn&#8217;t that difficult, but managing the state is a bit more tricky. The other thing to realize is that there are (atleast) two ways to play sound effects, one easy, one that takes a bit more code. The easy way you can use the built-in library of sounds, but it honors the physical &#8220;silent toggle switch&#8221; on the phone. Using an audio player takes a bit more code and you need your own audio files, but it will playback no matter the &#8216;silent mode&#8217; state.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Exchange Rates</h2>

<p>We do a lot of work for companies in the USA and in the next few weeks and months everyone&#8217;s going to feel the hurt. On March 14th, the exchange rate has been as low as it has ever been in the last 12 months. That doesn&#8217;t bode well for our bottomline getting paid in dollars.</p>
