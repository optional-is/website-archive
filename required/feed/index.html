					<description><![CDATA[A double weeknote from the road. We moved the office to sunny Tenerife for two weeks for a much needed change of scenery.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #751</h2>



<p>It was yet another short week because Friday was the <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f9e8.png" alt="ðŸ§¨" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f1fa-1f1f8.png" alt="ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> 4th of July in the USA. That meant things were quiet for those projects and we could catch-up a bit on some Australia work.</p>



<p>We continue to work on the WebRTC project. This week was less about the actual WebRTC and instead just about a web socket to &#8216;broadcast&#8217; to the other attendees metadata info. Who&#8217;s muted, playback and timecode. This all works and is hooked-up to other events.</p>



<p>This week we relocated the office to the Canary Islands for some much needed sun. We took along the IR filter for the camera and have been taking some photos around town. The sun is VERY bright, so the IR is pretty intense. It also means a decent shutter speed compared to Iceland.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IR-tenerife.jpg" alt="Infrared images of palm trees" /></figure>



<p>The place we&#8217;re staying at does not have free WiFi. It doesn&#8217;t cost much, but it&#8217;s still an inconvenience and they meter it by the number of devices. We didn&#8217;t even consider this, so when we&#8217;re back at the main office, we&#8217;re going to do a few experiments. MacOS lets you share one connection via another. What you can&#8217;t do is share the same connection both incoming and outgoing. For instance, you can&#8217;t have all your devices connect to your laptop via the WiFi, then also use your laptop&#8217;s WiFi to connect to the internet. But if you have two WiFi adapters, then it&#8217;s possible. We&#8217;re sure in the bottom of some cable draw we have a $5 UBC-A WiFi adapter. We&#8217;ll test it at home and add that to the travel tech kit for the future!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #752</h2>



<p>After a review of the WebRTC project status, our next major focus will be to get it working on tvOS! The library we&#8217;re using is not built for tvOS by default, but it seems others have managed, so we&#8217;re following their steps in the hope we can get it to work. We broke it down into three main tasks, get the library compiling as is (done), then update the source and target tvOS, then update the tvOS app to look for an external continuity camera as the video source.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, we sent out our <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/02025Q3/">Q3 Quarternotes newsletter</a>. Annoyingly, this time, when we sent it, as it was going out, our bulk mail provider decided to rate limit us and dropped a bunch of messages. After the script finished, we had to go to their logs, find out who already received the message, and re-send the email (minus those who already got it) with a few seconds delay between each message. What should have been a quick task ate up most of the morning!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Our global internet has roughly the same reaction time as a blue whale. When we start to think the Web as an animal, does that change our mindset into what's possible?]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When contemplating bandwidth, connective and latency, we like to use the blue whale as an anchor. We&#8217;ve brought this up in presentations and realized we&#8217;ve never documented our thoughts.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve wondered if the term <em>Robot</em> exists in plural? As more and more devices are connected to the internet, are they individual objects are part of something much larger. We look at ourselves as a human being, not our dividsible parts, organes, cells, bacteria or DNA. We are just the larger organisim. Will robots/phones/wearables/devices in the future be like our cells? Is it naive for us to think of them as individuals or maybe we are in the first phase, a pre-Cambrian device explosion?</p>



<p>No matter what your opinion, there are some physical limiting factors to achieving a single global brain. At the moment it is still impossible to exceed the speed of light. That means our messages passed over copper wires and fiber optic glass can&#8217;t go faster than that upper bound.</p>



<p>Your focus shouldn&#8217;t be bandwidth, instead: latency!</p>



<p>From Iceland, we found a website we know is hosted in New Zealand. That&#8217;s the closest diametrically opposed place from Reykjavik. At the moment when we send ping messages over the internet to the other side of the planet it takes about 560ms to get there and back (RTT Round Trip Time), 280ms each-way. We&#8217;ve seen 310ms as a quoted ping speed between Reykjavik and Wellington 17,261km away.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/material-opening.004.jpg" alt="A map of the world focused on Europe superimposed with an upside down of the world focused on Asia" /></figure>



<p>The speed of light is 299,792,458m/s and the Earth&#8217;s diameter is 12,756,000m. The fastest possible ping speed is 42.5ms. Currently, we&#8217;re still able to improve our speed by one order of magnitude.</p>



<p>If we compare that to the speed of our nervous system, it takes about 10ms for your neurons to send a signal 1 meter. For a tall, 2m (6ft) person, it would take ~20ms for your brain to register your foot stepped on something and the brain to recieve it. Hardware is much faster than wetware, but the distances are also much greater.</p>



<p>Keeping all this in mind, we looked into the largest mammal that has ever lived, the Blue Whale. It is around 30m in length. A nervous system signal traveling at 10ms per meter would take ~300ms for the message to travel from a Blue Whale&#8217;s tail through its body to the brain.</p>



<p>Right now, our global internet structure is almost as fast as the nervous system of a Blue Whale, and getting faster as more and cables are laid throughout the ocean.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/material-opening.009-1.jpg" alt="Black and White image of a woman next to a crack from an earthquake" /></figure>



<p>We&#8217;ve built a global nervous system we call the internet and it is the speed of our largest aquatic animals. If an earthquake occurs in California USA, halfway around the globe someone can find out faster than a blue whales detects something has touched its tail. Our global infrastructure is an amazing system which continues to improve. As more and more devices come online, we shouldn&#8217;t be thinking of them as stand-alone devices, but as small appendages to a much larger digital organism.</p>



<p>Right now our global internet&#8217;s round trip speed is at the Blue Whale stage, but it&#8217;s getting faster. Within continents, countries, regions and cities it is even faster! If we compare it to just one-way speeds (like an earthquake announcement) it becomes equivalent to smaller animals.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A double weeknote before our we close the office for some time away.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #749</h2>



<p>On Tuesday, Iceland celebrated National Day and Thursday was Juneteenth in the US. They were both public holidays chopping the week into three, one-day pieces. Projects were very stop and start, but we did make some progress. The WebRTC project hit another small milestone getting two apps to connect and conduct a video call. Now we&#8217;ve managed to get web-to-web, web-to-app, and app-to-app all communicating. Still lots of loose ends around multiple video participants, but progress is in the right direction.</p>



<p>Throughout the week, we&#8217;ve also been working on a project for the Australian concreters. We&#8217;ve had some minor web app improvements. Mostly quality of life stuff: better caching, color-coding table based on job type and improving permissions. We are also developing the web app further to handle another division in the company and its inventory management. It&#8217;s not a huge project, but not small either. We&#8217;re now at the point where a few decisions need to be made and we&#8217;ll have a late Sunday meeting to sync for the next week.</p>



<p>The procrastination on other tasks lead us to a productive Wednesday. Rather than do the tasks at hand, we took a break and went back to the survey projects. We have a list of summer tasks we want to look into, some small others large. We knocked out a few smaller ones; 2FA reset requests and a &#8216;welcome back info box&#8217; to confirm all the customer details at the start of the academic year. Next week the plan is to push the branches we&#8217;ve been working on to massively upgrade the software stack and dependencies. This will make maintenance and development easier, but also patch security issues and hopefully improve performance.</p>



<p>On Thursday, we met-up with a friend who&#8217;s also doing some VR work and other physical installation work and had a great long chat and catch-up. Even a few potential plans have emerged. Our main goal was to onboard him on an old VR project we built. Luckily it worked and went very smoothly!</p>



<p>On Friday, we published an article <a href="https://optional.is/required/2025/06/20/blind-men-and-the-elephant/">Blind Men and the Elephant</a>. We keep a close eye on technology and we&#8217;re always looking at new ways or lead indicators of where things are heading. Apple, Google, Meta, Samsung all have big product announcements. If you take all the pieces holistically and assume they are only a tiny part of something bigger, you begin to see companies developing the future in front of you without you even realizing it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #750</h2>



<p>We started the week off with our Australian concreters. The new inventory management system is taking shape. We have all the projects in the database with their inventory, projected usage, restock dates to help maintain some JIT (Just-in-time) delivery. The next big task is to get this data entered and map for actual job instances.</p>



<p>For our survey system, we&#8217;ve been upgrading all the libraries and generally brining everything up to the latest stable versions. In the process we&#8217;re dumping old code, reviewing login flows and fixing a few old bugs in the process. Once we merge the branch back into main, we&#8217;ll start the next task to update the themes to accommodate better readability fonts and colors, dark mode, and more modern CSS.</p>



<p>Thursday we spent out of the office down at the local co-working space. There was a lunchtime presentation by an AI company and most people left. We also managed to get a bunch of writing done and planning the publishing schedule for Q3.</p>



<p>For the next two weeks, we&#8217;re closing the office (mostly). Next week, the Q3 newsletter is queued-up and we&#8217;ll have another double weeknote highlighting our time off (we hope).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bric-Ã -brac</h2>



<p>We went down the rabbit hole of old Light Guns and how CRT monitors had incredible refresh rates compared to modern LCDs. In the Nintendo museum in Kyoto, there is a Zapper and Scope exhibition and it is interesting learn how they managed to bring this 40 year old tech up to modern day.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe title="How the Nintendo Zapper worked in Slow Motion - The Slow Mo Guys" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V6XnSvB34y8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>The slow-mo guys explain how the Zapper gun works. The gun is the receiver and the TV produces all black frames and frames where a white box represents a hit. The receiver then registers what it saw and that in turn was a hit or a miss.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Being like the blind men watching big tech companies develop in public isn't enough. You need to be able to connect all those dots and that's not easy.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>There is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_men_and_an_elephant">the parable of the blind men and an elephant</a> about searching and not understanding what you&#8217;ve found. Each man independently explores only a part of the animal and makes an incorrect assumption.</p>



<p>The first man fines the bristly tale and comes to the conclusion that it is a rope. The second climbs the back and says it is a cliff, the third finds the trunk and exclaims it is a snake. The fourth finds the elephant&#8217;s ears and thinks it&#8217;s a giant palm leaf. Each in turn only explores part of the elephant comes to an incorrect conclusion.</p>



<p>So what&#8217;s the take-away message? Are the blind men are dumb? No, they made good estimations based on what they felt. Where the error lies is in not sharing and combining their findings. Each had the hubris of assuming the others were wrong and they didn&#8217;t work together. The take-away message is to combine all the available information, weight it and then try to make an estimation of what the object might be with all the available knowledge. (Then update that model when new information appears!)</p>



<p>But what if they has no idea what an elephant was? How could they possibly put together all the available information and arrive at an elephant? Truthfully, they probably couldn&#8217;t, but they could arrive at a possible solution that it is something they&#8217;ve never seen before.</p>



<p>Each makes a wildly inaccurate prediction because they only have a tiny, localized portion of the overall object.</p>



<p><em>Exclude the impossible and what is left, however improbable, must be the truth</em> <br />(The Fate of the Evangeline by A. Conan Doyle, 01885)</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/The_Rhinoceros.jpg" alt="A woodcut depicting what they thought a rhinoceros looked like in 1515 based on oral information."/>
<figcaption>DÃ¼rer&#8217;s Rhinoceros is the name commonly given to a woodcut executed by German artist Albrecht DÃ¼rer in 01515.</figcaption>
</figure>



<aside>
<p>On 20 May 01515, an Indian rhinoceros named <cite>Ulysses</cite> arrived in Lisbon, Portugal. It was the first living rhino in Europe since Roman times. That same year, the German artist Albrecht DÃ¼rer made the infamous woodblock cut based on the rhinoceros. The problem was he never saw it in person. The illustration was based on an anonymous written description and brief sketch, hence the inaccurate depiction.</p>
<p>DÃ¼rer&#8217;s Rhinoceros is similar to that of our blind men. Few knew what an actual rhino looked like, so based on limited knowledge, he extrapolated and created this work of art.</p>
</aside>



<p>Today, we&#8217;re not discovering parts of an elephant are we? In our own way, yes. We deal a lot with technology and every year big tech companies have big events to show off their newest hardware creations. Apple, Google, Samsung and more all want to be market leaders with cutting edge technology. The problem is that the ecosystem is so big, it&#8217;s nearly impossible to break out of the chicken and egg cycle with a single announcement. So each year, the are laying tiny bits of ground work that we can see out in the open, but since we&#8217;ve never seen an &#8216;elephant&#8217; before we misinterpret those signs.</p>



<p>For instance, AR/XR glasses, similar to a pair of reading or sun glasses, are definitely being developed. If we look back we can see technology companies investing in voice agents. Why? because they need to build devices without direct input (no keyboards, mice or touch). They invested in LIDAR, image recognition, camera OCR (Optical Character Recognition), text-to-speech and speech-to-text, language translation, maps, widgets, sensors and more.</p>



<p>Like those blind men, we gather information about each of these technology nuggets, but never combine them back into something bigger. We&#8217;re not very good at connecting the dots and &#8220;seeing&#8221; something we&#8217;ve never imagined before.</p>



<p>The trick is to make a good educated guess about where things are heading. Given the technology we have today, what&#8217;s coming down the pipes and read the &#8216;tea leaves&#8217; of what those big companies are really pushing their developers to experiment with, can (potentially) give you a glimpse into the future. If you&#8217;re good at it, then you&#8217;ll be successful.</p>



<p><em>Don&#8217;t skate to where the puck is, skate to where it&#8217;s heading.</em></p>



<p>Stay ahead, look at the direction things are heading, and get their first. Use those weak signals to your advantage. You won&#8217;t be right all the time, but if you continue to take onboard more information, weight and refine you&#8217;ll get closer and closer to the target every time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A quick double weeknote: Mostly WebRTC, planning, WWDC and reacting.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #747</h2>



<p>We continue to take small bits out of our WebRTC project. The libraries and sample code out there are all written in swift using UIKit. We have gone all in for SwiftUI, which is swift, but not the normal app life-cycle. We ported the sample code from Swift UIKit to SwiftUI and managed to get everything talking between the app and web. Baby steps.</p>



<p>The whole week, we did some prep work on a pitch meeting on Friday. The meeting was focused on something else, but we needed a plan B incase the audience wasn&#8217;t interested. Luckily, they were, and after a 2h meeting, our Plan B never got mentioned. It&#8217;s always a bit of a downer after you rush to put in a bunch of work to not even get it shown, but it&#8217;s not wasted effort. Once the dust settles a bit, we&#8217;ve got a really good prototype and deck ready to go at a moments notice.</p>



<p>On Friday, we published our article <a href="https://optional.is/required/2025/06/06/disney-flowchart/">Disney Flowchart</a>. Back in 01957, Walt Disney created a flow chart to better explain how all the different parts of his company interacted. We have thought about what our version of this flow chart would be, and how we can use it to identify places for improvement and things to watch out.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #748</h2>



<p>Monday was a public holiday in Iceland. It was also Apple&#8217;s annual WWDC (World Wide Developer Conference). We have several projects using Apple&#8217;s tech, so we kept an eye on what&#8217;s new. The biggest change is this Liquid Glass theme for all the OS 26 versions. We&#8217;ll see how it pans out through all the betas.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, Salesforce and Heroku had a major outage. We use Heroku for lots of projects and for some projects the sites were down, others were up but we couldn&#8217;t deploy. It took over 8 hours for them to resolve the problems. Luckily for us, our surveys are done for the year and other projects in Australia were down mostly through their evening. </p>



<p>We continue to work on our WebRTC project. We have web-to-web video working, we also have app-to-web working, and app-to-app is nearly there. The next big tasks are to get it for more than just two participants via an app, starting to style it, get can video playback working, and the biggest task to get it working on tvOS. Out-of-the-box, this isn&#8217;t possible, but some people have managed it. But that&#8217;s a later task.</p>



<p>This week was full of meetings. Some Calendar UI/UX planning, PETALS planning, project feedback and more. It makes getting work done a bit harder when you&#8217;re stopping and starting for meetings, but they are a necessary evil to move some things ahead.</p>



<p>Finally, we watch as the US dollar (USD) to the Icelandic Kronur (ISK) continues to sink! At its peak in Mid-February, it was 142 ISK to the Dollar. This week it was down to 123 ISK. <a href="https://www.irs.gov/individuals/international-taxpayers/yearly-average-currency-exchange-rates">According to the US IRS</a>, the average USD-&gt;ISK for 02024 &amp; 02023 was a shade under 138. That means our invoices are worth 11% less than previous years, coupled with a 10% inflation in Iceland, these US jobs either need a drastic increase in the rates or de-prioritized.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[This flow chart from 01957 is just as relevant today as it was then. Figuring out how all the different parts of your company can compliment and support the others is strategically important.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Back in 01957, Walt Disney created this flow chart to sell his idea to investors.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/disney-2-1024x896.jpeg" alt="Hand drawn flowchart of Disney products"/>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>



<p>You can see how this flow chart shows directs various products into each other. It is a good reminder that there are some parts of the company that might in themselves loose money, but because they are promoting other parts they are still vital to the whole.</p>



<p>We should also remember that this diagram is only a snapshot in time. Which of these company divisions are ephemeral and which evolved (or disappeared) over time? 16mm films probably became 35mm films, which became DVDs, which became Disney+ streaming. Sure the &#8220;noun&#8221; might have changed but the role remained the same.</p>



<p>Then there are some divisions that have all but disappeared and/or their importance in this graph have shifted. The <em>newspaper comic strip</em> was probably an institution in the 01950s, but less so in 02025. How do you plan for a changing business model?</p>



<p>Finally, which divisions are the main actors and which play a supporting role? Not everything has to be two-way traffic, some can be there to only serve and others only to be served.</p>



<p>This got us thinking about (optional.is). What is our flow diagram? And how would/could we improve on it? Knowing a bit more about our resources we can see which are not playing a strong enough roll in the larger flow diagram.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/flowchart.jpg" alt="Handdrawn flow chart of optional.is' interactions" /><figcaption>A flow chart showing how all parts of the company are interacting with each other. This is a back-of-the-napkin sketch that will continue to improve over time.</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>If we look at our major actors, some of these have dwindled. <a href="https://analog.is">Analog.is</a> exists and we are still selling our notebook stock, but given that every package that leaves Iceland needs to be tracked it makes the cost very prohibitive for small orders. We&#8217;re looking for alternatives, but it isn&#8217;t a high priority given the profit on a notebook order versus our hourly rate. For our <a href="https://adventure-mazes.com">Adventure Mazes</a> project, we tried to outsource all that to Amazon&#8217;s Kindle Print On Demand service. It works, they take a big chunk and all the promotion falls on us.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://material.is">Material Conference</a> is also another product that we would love to promote more. The first three events improved over time. The first, a kickstarter event never happened. The second was off to a good start and the third grew the audience further. Our fourth was set for March 02020, but was canceled due to COVID and we&#8217;ve never managed to get the momentum to start it up again. We&#8217;re back to square one.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Working Smarter not Harder</h2>



<p>Most of our work is hourly or retainer-based rather than product related. At the turn of the century, 25+ years ago, Web 2.0 was the hot topic and many companies were moving from a client run business to product run. We saw 37signals launch Basecamp and stop taking client work. Coudal Partners started Field Notes and other crazy ideas. We&#8217;ve watched with envy and even tried a few things of our own.</p>



<p>Making the transition between selling your time to selling &#8216;things&#8217; isn&#8217;t always an easy one. There are new and different problems. Making a flow diagram like Walt Disney did nearly 70 years ago might help. </p>



<p><em>No [product] is an island.</em></p>



<p>Everything exists in a larger system. The sooner you map out and understand the relationships, the better chance you have of success. Not only understanding what contributes where, but also how much. The flow chart indicates three sources of revenue: Client Work, Products and Conferences, but they bring in vastly different amounts!</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A double weeknote where we're mostly back into app development (aka artisan web browser world). But we also spent a lot of time dealing with our backups.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #745</h2>



<p>Wrangling tvOS is a pain. Given the user input it not touch it has some strange default behaviors. They are nothing that can&#8217;t be fixed, but it&#8217;s good to try and develop in tandem with iOS so you can fix both as you go along and built it &#8216;right&#8217; from the start. on tvOS buttons and lists all require special love and care to get the default interactions and focus.</p>



<p>This week we went down a big rabbit hole over Apple Game Center achievements. We setup a way to reward achievements using the App Store Connect API outside of the app. There are two main reasons for this: We&#8217;ve added some new achievements which are unreachable if you&#8217;re an older player. Our new script is a way to backfill some of that data. The other reasons revolve around achievements that are not tied to the game. We have some ideas around interesting things we can do, but we&#8217;ll wait and see if it is worth the effort (or even allowed).</p>



<p>On Thursday we published an article about our <a href="https://optional.is/required/2025/05/22/ornithoto-camera-app/">new iPhone camera app: Ornithoto</a>. This is a bit of a deeper explanation of the app, it&#8217;s inspiration, some technical aspects and more. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ornithoto/id1665382610?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Ornithoto is available on the Apple App Store</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Backups</h3>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<blockquote>You don&#8217;t have a back-up until you restore!</blockquote>
</blockquote>



<p>A wise man who works in operations once told us: You don&#8217;t have a back-up until you restore. It made sense at the time, but who ever really restores from a backup as a test? On a personal machine, you need to get work done and its expense to have a second machine just to test your backups, so no one does. Our backup regime is pretty good. We have an air-gapped external hard drive we backup too monthly, we have daily Time Machine backups and those are copied offsite. This week, something happened to the local TimeMachine hard drive. Some bits got crossed and the local backups needed to be purged. Nothing to worry about, we still have the data in 3 place (on the device, the slightly out-of-date air-gap external drive, and the remote backup). As a test, we decided to copy the remote backups locally again and continue from there. After a few days of waiting to rsync the data back, the .sparsebundle backups didn&#8217;t work. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f62c.png" alt="ðŸ˜¬" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>This was good to find out. We needed to figure out if the remote backup files corrupt or were they borked when trying copy them locally again? How can we prevent this from happening? Either way, we started fresh now and got the local backups going again and sync them remotely.</p>



<p>After doing some homework, it turns out that we were using the <code>--ignore-existing</code> flag with rsync. We (wrongly) assumed that if the file already existed (and was the same) it would skip it. What that parameter actually does is ignore all checks if the file already is there, in any shape or form, and it skips it. That meant our updated files and incremental backups were never updating!</p>



<p>As annoying as this is, we&#8217;re not stressed (yet), because this only affected the remote backups. It&#8217;s best to find these things under happy times rather than in a stressful situation! </p>



<p><strong>It&#8217;s true that you never have a backup until you restore it!</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #746</h2>



<p>This was a short week. Monday was a public holiday in the USA. Thursday was a public holiday in Iceland and then lots of places were closed on Friday to make a long weekend. </p>



<p>This week we continued working on some WebRTC stuff. Getting it to work on tvOS is going to prove a bit trickier. The library I found does not natively work on tvOS, but some people have managed to make some changes and get it to work, so we&#8217;re positive. Out tests with demo apps we&#8217;ve built from source code do work, now it&#8217;s getting that into our prototypes.</p>



<p>On another web project, we&#8217;ve been contemplating giving things a fresh look. That will require us to revisit our CSS workflow. Right now we have a small script that runs when we commit our code into the repo. It builds the SASS files into CSS and combines and compresses our Javascript and CSS files as needed. It&#8217;s a very old workflow that is over-engineered for our needs. This summer we&#8217;ll revisit all of this, but for now, we&#8217;re making a plan. This will simplify the CSS, get us a dark mode, modernize the code with variables and in general get rid of a bunch of cruft.</p>



<p>For our tablet/VR project, we&#8217;re now getting to the part that&#8217;s less about the customer facing product and more about the user permissions for the client&#8217;s team. We&#8217;ve been building a permission system for the editors who will log into the Web Admin tool to manage assets. Now we&#8217;re changing to the permission system of those who can log into the actual customer app. Those permissions are completely different. They are read-only on a page-by-page level. Then we need to think of parent and children pages as well and what permissions are inherited.</p>



<p>In preparation for meetings in June, we&#8217;re putting together some prototype updates and a slide deck for a smaller side project. It won&#8217;t be the focus of the meeting, but certainly an extra at the end, or if the main project gets zero traction in the meeting, we have a plan B.</p>



<p>Finally, on Sunday night (which is Monday morning in Australia) we have a call for another project kick-off. This one is with an existing client who&#8217;s looking to expand their business into new product which means and update to their web app job and inventory tracking system we built.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[An experimental camera app for the iPhone. It lets you create long exposures to capture motion or light.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[

</figure>



<p>Ornithoto is an experimental, long exposure camera app for the iPhone that uses the video feed and various blend modes to produce as interesting photograph.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Inspiration</h2>



<p>Years ago, we saw some amazing &#8220;Ornithographies&#8221; by <a href="https://xavibou.com">Xavi Bou</a>. We wrote about his photos in our <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/02016Q3/">02016Q3 newsletter</a>. His process is to take loads and loads of photos and then combine them to see the trails of birds in flight. They are amazing to see and we wanted to emulate the results! To create images like his takes a lot of work and patience. We wanted something simpler, albeit not as precise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Name</h2>



<p>Getting our inspiration from Xavi&#8217;s Ornithographies, we choose to use Ornithoto. &#8220;Ornis&#8221; is the Greek word for &#8220;bird&#8221; and &#8220;oto&#8221; was from &#8220;photo(graph)&#8221;. It might turn out to be a horrible name, but if you search for it, there aren&#8217;t many results (yet). </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">App Icon</h2>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/ornithoto-app-icons.jpg" alt="6 app icon variations" />
<figcaption>Exploring various app icons. Light, Dark, and Monotone versions.</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>We need to re-visit the current icon to something more bird related. In the meantime, we looked to history for other famous time lapse images. We took frames from the series of photos taken by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eadweard_Muybridge">Eadweard Muybridge</a> to settle the famous bet: Does a horse&#8217;s feet leave the ground when it is running?</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The_Horse_in_Motion_high_res.jpg" alt="" />
<figcaption>Muybridge&#8217;s <cite>The Horse in Motion</cite>, 01878</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>We layered a few of the frames, colorized them and used blending modes to create the effect akin to what the app does. This is just the first iteration, the app icon will evolve over time. We needed something unique that explains the camera app&#8217;s results. There&#8217;s always room for improvement, but we&#8217;re not going to let creating the perfect app icon stopping us from releasing for more feedback.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Technical</h2>



<p>The app takes the 4K video feed and blends the frames in realtime in memory. Each frame from the video buffer is applied with the bend mode to our temp image. We repeat that process over and over again based on the frame rate you choose: 60fps, 30fps, 10fps, etc. The lower the frame rate the more time passes between each merged frame of the video. When you stop recording, the app takes that temp image which is all the video frames blended together one at a time and saves it to your photo album. It then resets for the next iteration and waits for you to take your next long exposure video.</p>



<p>There are two possible blend modes you can use in Ornithoto: Lighten and Darken. They work in opposite ways. With Lighten, when the video frame images is blended to the temp image, which ever pixel at the (x,y) coordinate is &#8216;lighter&#8217; that is saved to the temp image. The inverse is true for Darken, which ever pixel is &#8216;darker&#8217;, that is saved. Depending on the blend mode, it captures trails of light or motion.</p>



<p>It takes lots of practice to get the correct fps for different situations. Fast moving cars need slower fps than birds. What you are taking photos of also make a difference. Subjects like dark colored birds on a light colored sky work really well because with each blend, the darker bird is represented easily on the lighter background with little visual noise. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Download</h2>



<p><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ornithoto/id1665382610?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Ornithoto is available on the App Store</a>. Right now it&#8217;s free, but we plan on setting a small price. So grab it while you can to get future updates for free. Charging a small amount sets a barrier. If we have to deal with support requests, bugs, features etc. they will be coming from people who are invested in using the app.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Feedback</h2>



<p>We soft-launched the app, first with friends, then to the general public. We took the feedback and folded much of it back into the app. We are not a full-time iOS development company, we like to tinker and solve problems. If for some reason the app is not working, looks strange or is broken on your device, please let us know and we&#8217;ll work on a fix.</p>



<p>If you&#8217;re a photographer and want to give it a try, have questions or your own idea for a camera app, let us know.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">About</h2>



<p>We like to dabble with learning about new technologies. Learning about what&#8217;s possible, how things work and see where we can push the limits are always things we&#8217;re interested in. Our background is focused on the Web and Internet, not app development. We don&#8217;t tend to jump first into any sort of proprietary app development.</p>



<p>Building apps and exploring the pros and cons is part of the curiosity that stems from all the nooks and crannies that the Web hasn&#8217;t reached yet. Could we have built this same camera as a Web page? Maybe. We&#8217;d need access to the camera, get the video frames, put them into a canvas element while trying to also do all the maths to get the blend modes working.</p>



<p>Creating an app gets us a few less levels removed from the bare metal. Instead of javascript, in a browser, accessing a hardware camera and apply GPU transforms, we can get all the benefits of the operating system by using an app.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A double weeknote covering lots of projects, some admin, and chasing a few leads.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #743</h2>



<p>On Thursday we pushed a big update to the <a href="https://petals.team">PETALS</a> app. Of course there were a few minor deploy hiccups. Something todo with minor changes between the settings on the DEV server compared to the PROD server cause some HTTPS infinite redirects. </p>



<p>On the VR/Tablet front, we&#8217;ve continued to work on some permissions on the web admin tool to manage content. We&#8217;ve also been exploring porting some experimental code to view stereoscopic 360 images in to the VR app.</p>



<p>On our join Calendar redesign project, we worked on converting some Figma sketches into responsive HTML. The original design was great for a single event and countdown. We took that design and made a compact view that displayed 4-5 countdowns in the same space.</p>



<p>One project from Australia needed some minor tweaking. We&#8217;ve built several systems now for various companies to help them with logging worker&#8217;s time to projects and pushing those timesheets into their accounting software Xero. This small tweak was to track jobs as contracted and alert them to invoice them accordingly.</p>



<p>The WebRTC continues to move forward. We&#8217;ve refactored a lot of code to make sure it is all working on the web with multiple participants. We&#8217;re now looping back to the code to make sure it can also work on iOS (android later, but WebRTC is an open standard so we&#8217;re not too worried)</p>



<p>For some projects we introduced a QR code TOTP for two-factor authentication. We moved this direction since island.is closed their SSO for non-governmental organizations. Instead of paying the fees for other services, we copied the University of Iceland and recommend an authenticator app. That has worked well, but some of our customers manage to delete the entry, never save it, can&#8217;t find it, or change devices. So we have no way to reset the 2FA except to call us. Our goal this summer is to replace that with an SMS reset. Request a reset, get an SMS with a code to a number you have on file, use that to login instead, then re-setup the 2FA.</p>



<p>We also soft launched our <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ornithoto/id1665382610?ls=1&amp;mt=8">Ornithoto app for the iPhone</a>. This is a camera all that takes long exposures by using different blend modes between video frames to create a single image. We recommend you download it now, even if you aren&#8217;t planning on using it. In a few months we&#8217;ll set a price on the download, but if you download it now, all future updates will be free.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #744</h2>



<p>There are two potential new Australian projects. The first is a rather large on to help inventory management, installation teams and more is on hold until the &#8216;actual&#8217; workflow is hammered out to a repeatable process that we can convert into some web-based forms.</p>



<p>There was a bunch of iOS dev work on various projects. After soft-launching we got lots of little feedback about the Ornithoto app. We made some bug fixes, lowered the required OS version and made some UX improvements.</p>



<p>For a friend, we&#8217;ve been building a small data tracker. In the past she&#8217;d used several different apps to track a medical condition, medication and other health metrics. Sadly, these apps keep going offline or are region locked. Off-and-on, we&#8217;ve been building a simple tool for her to collect, record and visualize the data on a calendar view (and maybe more in the future). Since it is a not a public projects associated with a company, ironically, it might have a longer life-span than others.</p>



<p>We continued with the WebRTC project. We didn&#8217;t manage to get the iOS WebRTC libraries integrated yet, but we did manage to bring the iOS and tvOS apps (mostly) up to parity with the web. Almost all the features of the web are not APIs to the apps. The tvOS app needed a bunch of button refactoring since moving focus on a screen with a remote is very different than direct touch input.</p>



<p>Our bi-monthly VAT was due for March/April. We use a service called <a href="https://payday.is">PayDay.is</a> which managed all the invoicing, expenses and payroll, so the VAT reports are usually just us quickly reviewing to make sure we didn&#8217;t forget to add any recipes and pressing send.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bric-Ã -brac</h2>



<p>Something in our heads this week made this bubble up: SEGA&#8217;s mid-90s &#8220;WELCOME TO THE NEXT LEVEL&#8221; marketing campaign.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We tend to think of singular events that radically change the direction. In reality, it is more likely a slow turning of the tide and a faster snowball effect.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/sawtooth_and_sine_wave.png" alt="Sawtooth line graph overlayed with a Sine wave" /></figure>



<p>Rarely do events in nature have a very dramatic flip from one state to another.</p>



<p>Most people probably think in Sawtooth motion, when in reality it is usually more of a Sine wave. This has implications not only for the moment when it transitions between two states, but also the mid-point between them.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take for instance the equinoxes and solstices. These are significant days when dealing with the sine wave. At the peaks and troughs, (solstices) these are the shortest and longest days. These are the transition points between each day getting shorter versus getting longer. Up to this point was NOT a constant loss of an equal number of seconds each day. The day before or after a solstice is just 6-10 seconds longer or shorter, and the day before that maybe 7-15 seconds. As we approach the solstice, we ease in or out of the length of the day.</p>



<p>Had this been a Sawtooth motion, every day losses and equal amount of time until the solstice where it would magically flip and reverse direction gaining or losing an equal about of daylight each day.</p>



<p>The other important thing to remember about a Sine wave is that during the mid-point, the equinoxes, you are half-way between the two state changes. This is when the velocity is at its maximum and the acceleration flips. If during a solstice, you gain or lose seconds each day, at the equinox it is minutes. This is the steepest part of the curve so there is the most rate of change. This never happens in a Sawtooth motion since the velocity is constant.</p>



<p><strong>Think in Sine waves, not Sawtooths. </strong></p>



<p>Getting started is hard, changing can take time, but once things get moving they can accelerate fast.</p>
