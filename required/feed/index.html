					<description><![CDATA[A look back at 365 days of news in 02024.

Every morning, we save a few interesting headlines. In isolation they are just click-bait for an article, but taking a longer view, we can see larger trends.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>02024 Daily News</strong></h2>



<p>This is the third year we&#8217;ve collected headlines daily. The original idea behind this was that news stories don&#8217;t last a day, but we ready them in a serialized daily format. We wanted a way to look at trends and breadth of a story. These headlines are completely biased to both personal tastes, presumed historic value and news corporations publication interest. </p>



<p>Every year a new smart phone is released, that&#8217;s less &#8220;news&#8221; and more of a &#8220;press release&#8221;. We are looking for headlines that might take days, weeks or years to play out. That‚Äôs not to say there aren‚Äôt some one-off headlines and add value in seeing them in context.</p>



<p><a href="https://optional.is/required/2023/01/10/02022-til/">02022 TIL</a> and <a href="https://optional.is/required/2024/01/23/02023-til/">02023 TIL</a> are also worth skimming over since a news story doesn&#8217;t always stop and start in a day. Some take weeks, or even years to develop.</p>



<p>This is a list of ‚ÄúThis Year I Learnt‚Äù headlines from various news sources and hashtags we added. Some of the events listed might have happened the day before the news broke or due to timezone, some events might have occurred in the future in relation to the local news website‚Äôs geographic location.</p>



<p>These headlines are (mostly) verbatim from the website. We didn‚Äôt write them, but saved the exact text to make it easier to copy and paste into any search engine and find the original. There are different spellings for various people and places ‚Äì that‚Äôs not out typo, that‚Äôs different news organization style guides. After three year‚Äôs worth of headlines, we should have also saved the original link for the citation. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f937-1f3fb-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p><a href="#headline-stats">At the end of the list, we‚Äôve complied a stats list with a general overview</a>.</p>

<p>We added #hashtags to some of the headlines to help us aggregate some data. These are arbitrary as well and a single #tag might cover a much larger topic. For instance #ukraine is used for headlines related to Ukraine, but also the Russian invasion.</p>



<p>When we compare some of our categories to <a href="https://optional.is/required/2024/01/23/02023-til/">TIL 02023</a>, some are roughly consistent, like #obituaries and #space, but others are not! This year seems to be very #politics heavy. We also tried to include news in more countries, keeping an eye on Africa and South America as well. Others are fads, #crypto is down and #ai is up!</p>



<p>This is the third year we&#8217;ve done this and like previous years, we should have saved the source link as well. We have plans for something todo with the data, but haven&#8217;t had the time to build the tools. There‚Äôs always next year.</p>



<p>There are certainly were some major news stories we missed, others we got the outcome, but maybe not the seeds. This is a biased collection and will always have flaws, but we do our best to keep it interesting and look for over-arching trends that might take weeks or months to come to fruition. Things that regular media might gloss-over, but seeing them in a year-long context might give us a different perspective.</p>



<p>We‚Äôre open for feedback from this long list and adjust for 02025. We‚Äôve found it interesting to read back over the news and see what our past-selves thought was interesting.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A quadruple weeknote, but most of this was the Christmas holidays.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Happy New Year!</h2>



<p>We&#8217;re heading into 02025. Week #726 was our first full week back at the office, but that doesn&#8217;t mean the last 4 weeks weren&#8217;t busy!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Publishing Schedule</h2>



<p>At the end of 02024, we decided to pause the <strong>‚™Æ Good Morning Newsletter</strong> in 02025 and instead focus on writing here. We&#8217;ll see how things go, maybe the pendulum will swing back. Our <strong>‚óç Quarter notes</strong> newsletter is still published each quarter. You can subscribe to get it delivered to your <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/">inbox</a> or <a href="https://optional.is/feeds/">feed reader</a>.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/02025-publishing-plan.jpg" alt="A4 paper with four columns, each column is a calendar quarter"/></figure>



<p>We have over 100 draft articles and it is time we go through that. So we planned out Q1&#8217;s publishing schedule. The cadence is to have one article published a week. That might be a weeknote like these, a regular article, or newsletter. That&#8217;s the goal, we&#8217;ll see how well it goes!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #726</h2>



<p>This week, and year, have started slowly. Many of our contacts are still out and as they return, they need to dig themselves out of their backlog before we can get started again.</p>



<p>We started the week by updating and clearing-out old surveys in preparation for this spring. We&#8217;re looking to improve our sampling method. For big schools in Reykjavik, there is a chance that over the 10 years your child is in the school, you MIGHT not get randomly sampled. We&#8217;re starting to keep a hash list of previous participants and change the sampling to decrease the odds someone previously sampled will be sampled again.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-10-at-10.35.08.png" alt="Screenshot of 4 iPhone screens featuring a simple dice rolling app that looks more like a calculator" /></figure>



<p>As part of another project, we&#8217;ve been tasked with looking into Apple&#8217;s App Clips. One app we&#8217;ve been sitting on is a simple Dice Roller. We used it as an example app to build something in SwiftUI and made an App Clip. Now you can scan a QR code and get a quick dice roller without having to download an app. After getting everything setup we submitted it to Apple only to get rejected as Spam! We put in an appeal, but we&#8217;ll see how long this process takes!</p>



<p>We have an Apple Watch and found out there are options for the Portrait watchface that are not exposed through the UI! If you share a watchface from the UI to yourself the resulting Protrait.watchface file is just a .zip (rename it and unpack it). There is a /Resources folder with an Images.plist file. In there you can specify all sorts of things, like clock size, position, a background, foreground and image mask! We&#8217;ve managed to get nice portrait like effects using illustrations.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/incoming-eb596071-b042-465e-810c-2d356a13acfa_360.png" alt="Screenshot of Apple Watch Face of Japanese Ukiyo-e Print"/></figure>



<p>We had lots of fun with this! Our plan is to package up a few of our favorite experiments, re-zip them, rename them back to .watchface and put them up for anyone to download.</p>



<p>Summer Project has woken up! They managed to get some funding a few weeks ago and now are scaling-up. My contact who was coding is now trying to hire, plan and code, so we&#8217;ve stepped back in a bit to help with some of the lower-level maintenance tasks until they can hire more folks and get over the hump.</p>



<p>Our Australian Plumber project has gone quiet. They formed a new parent company and in that process they legally needed to setup a new Xero account for taxes. We took our own project code, replicated, OAuth&#8217;ed to their new account and changed a few of the variables for where to fetch projects, pay rates, etc. They entered some of their team members and projects and we correctly imported them. The goal was to switch over before the new year, but no word on how that&#8217;s going.</p>



<p>On Thursday, we sent out our <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/02025Q1/">02025Q1 ‚óç Quarternotes newsletter</a> all about Clickbait and Dumbbells.</p>



<p>On Friday, we got back on track with PETALS. We had a team sync to plan and generally get back on track.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fluxcapacitor</h2>



<p>This week in 02014, was weeknote #152. Our triple weeknote <a href="https://optional.is/required/2014/01/10/week-150-152/">Week #150-152</a> covers what we were up to 11 years ago!</p>



<p>Even further back in 02011, we wrote about <a href="https://optional.is/required/2011/01/12/maximum-color-contrast/">Maximum Color Contrast</a>. If you need to find out if black or white text has higher contrast on your chosen color, there are a few methods.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Every year, we look back at all the articles we've written and add updates as needed.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This is the Omnibus for 02024, where we look back at previous year‚Äôs posts and make various updates that we‚Äôve noticed. We started this trend 15 years ago, all the way back in 02009.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Articles</h2>



<p>This year we managed to publish 19 weeknotes covering on average 3.7 weeks with each and 6 non-weeknote articles. The average word count was around 1,700, up from last year&#8217;s ~1,450.</p>



<p>Of the 6 articles we managed to write, 3 were internal, long-running, yearly articles and the other three were also internal related, but mostly about our internet network and backup setup.</p>

<p>We have over 100+ articles in our drafts folder. Some are just a headline and some notes, some are fairly flushed out, but either need some finishing touches or client approval before we can publish them.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Follow-ups</h3>



<p>Back in 02009, we wrote <a href="https://optional.is/required/2009/06/18/how-dark-is-your-data-shadow/">How dark is your data shadow?</a> It focused on how much data we share willingly and what could/does happen downstream. In late 02024, it turned out that for years as people have been playing Pok√©mon Go, they have been donating real-world scans to the parent company Niantic who&#8217;ve been using that to build a&nbsp;<a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/nianticspatial?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">visual positioning system</a>&nbsp;(VPS).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Newsletters</h2>



<p>The was the 3rd year of our <strong>‚™Æ Good Morning</strong> newsletter. We&#8217;ve decided to put Season 4 on ice. It will happen, but we need a bit of a break. You can read more about it here: <a href="https://optional.is/required/2024/12/18/on-newsletter-publishing/">On Newsletter Publishing</a>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/">Season 3 archive is online</a> for anyone to read. Each newsletter was 4 topics with a description and supporting links for each.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/gm-s03.png" alt="Screenshot collage of all 12 episodes of the Good Morning newsletter for 02024"/></figure>



<p>Our <strong>‚óç Quarternotes</strong> newsletter isn&#8217;t going anywhere. It is a blend of what we&#8217;re up-to along with some interesting links to read about.</p>



<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4e9.png" alt="üì©" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />&nbsp;<a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/">Subscribe to get each episodes</a>&nbsp;delivered monthly to your inbox.<br /><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4e1.png" alt="üì°" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://optional.is/feeds/">Follow our Feeds</a> to never miss a newsletter.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Travel</h2>



<p>In March, we went to San Francisco for GDC (Game Developers Conference). We weren&#8217;t there in attendance, but more for meetings, planning, etc. while everyone was in town.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/sf-march-02024.jpg" alt="Collage of black and white photos of San Francisco trolly cars and skyline." /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">San Francisco in Black and White. Two photos using the TinType app of the famous street cars and a 3rd from high-up using the Infrared filter.</figcaption></figure>



<p>While in San Francisco, we took the opportunity to go to the Lamy store. We picked-up a <a href="https://www.lamy.com">Lamy</a> Joy Calligraphy fountain pen. They are great entry-level fountain pens if you&#8217;re just getting started. We&#8217;ve been enjoying using it off and on through out 02024 with mixed results. To be honest, we&#8217;re more team BIC 4-Color &#8211; they&#8217;re not exciting, but super reliable and useful.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lamy-joy.jpg" alt="Red Lamy Joy fountain pen capped on a piece of paper with test calligraphy doodles"/></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What‚Äôs Next in 02025?</h2>



<p>We&#8217;ll continue deeper on our AR/VR project. The concept for ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà which we may or may not ever hear back about or be able to talk about, might bloom something? The other project we started helping with over the summer closed some funding in December and we&#8217;ll continue to help/advice/bug fix as they scale-up.</p>



<p>We dabbled our toes in 3D modeling and have gotten some good results. Maybe we&#8217;ll see more experiments this year, like AR products you can view on your device! We don&#8217;t have to be great at it, just know the limits, tools and workflow. We can spend the time on the details once we have the needs &#8211; maybe in 02025?</p>



<p>No travel plans so far. Possibly something in March around GDC again, but we won&#8217;t know for a while.</p>



<p>We have more print-on-demand ideas and have been shopping one idea around locally to publishers, but so far everyone we&#8217;ve asked has said no, but everyone we&#8217;ve shown the prototype to loves it! One store is willing to stock it if we have them printed. So maybe that&#8217;s something todo this year.</p>



<p>We are pausing the <strong>‚™Æ Good Morning</strong> newsletter season 4 to try and get back into writing. We have a bunch of articles lined-up, we just need to put the finishing touches on them and be ready to promote them once they are published. Not focusing on two different newsletters will hopefully free-up some space to write more.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We're spent some time re-evaluating the effort needed for our newsletters and the goals we wanted to accomplish. Now it is time for a bit of a re-shuffle.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/">We&#8217;ve been publishing a newsletter</a> in some form since 02012. That&#8217;s over 12 years! We were driven to start during in the early days of social media. In the world of ephemeral short messages on Twitter/Pounce/Jauku (and others), a newsletter felt different. When someone gives you their email address, they are welcoming you into their inbox. RSS is great, but certainly doesn&#8217;t have the same level of trust or commitment.</p>



<p>Some people argue that a newsletter is (or should be) a blog post. They certainly do share a lot of overlap in terms of content, but they are also unique in their own way. With a blog post/article that we sporadically write, it could a hodgepodge of ideas quickly put together or something abstract or some topic we&#8217;ve recently been deep into. Our newsletters are much more curated, structured, self-promoting and have some cadence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Newsletters</h2>



<p>When we started our newsletter we wanted to deliver something fun and interesting to our readership. We chose quarterly since that was a timeframe we felt that we could reasonably accomplish without missing deadlines. For the longest time, the newsletter was a mix of what we were up too as a company, speaking engagements, and some interesting links. Over time those themes ebbed and flowed in amount and quality.</p>



<p>So three years ago, we decided to split the newsletter in two. Our quarterly newsletter would be <strong>‚óç Quarternotes</strong> (a play on the weekly weeknotes) and would focus mostly on internal projects, plenty of self-promotion and something interesting we could write about. Then the second newsletter called <strong>‚™Æ Good Morning</strong> would be monthly with no self-promotion and just a series of links and a short description on why it was interesting.</p>



<p>At this time we also left our previous bulk mailing service MailChimp, partly because Intuit bought them and partly because we wanted to opt-out of all the tracking. So, like any computer programmer, we rolled our own newsletter tool. From composing to publishing to sending, we built something ugly, but usable for us. That means we have complete control on how we manage the messages. There is an HTML and plain-text version of the emails with dark-mode CSS available and no tracking query strings.</p>



<p>We made a conscious choice not to track our readers. That has taken some burden off of &#8220;will this link get the engagement numbers we want&#8221; because we don&#8217;t have any numbers. The biggest downside is that we rarely get any feedback. We don&#8217;t have an open rate. We don&#8217;t know if people like it. For the most part, all we have are the server logs for the public, published page.</p>



<p>The last three years of newsletters have been a lot of work setting up, researching and writing to then sending them into a black hole. We know people read each newsletter, some people reply, some people mention it on social media, but overall we&#8217;re missing the discussion and feedback.</p>



<p>The goal was always to have the newsletter somewhere at the &#8220;top of the funnel&#8221; and use it to promote and sell other products. But for the last few years, we haven&#8217;t really been speaking, selling or have anything to directly promote (except ourselves). It was time to re-evaluate our newsletters.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">‚™Æ Good Morning</h3>



<p><a href="https://craigmod.com/essays/popup_newsletters/">Back in 02021, Craig Mod wrote about newsletters</a>. We took some of that advice and applied it to our <strong>‚™Æ Good Morning</strong> newsletter. We set this up as a monthly newsletter and annual seasons. We felt that collecting 3-4 short, interesting links each month would be well within our ability and if things became too burdensome, we only had to stick it out until the end of the year!</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/gm-s01.png" alt="Screenshot collage of all of season 1 newsletters" /></figure>

<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/gm-s03.png" alt="Screenshot collage of all of season 3 newsletters"/></figure>



<p>We managed to get 36 episodes over 3 seasons written and published, but now it is time for a rest. With the demise of Twitter and the shift to Mastodon (and off social media in general) means we&#8217;re not seeing or collecting as many interesting links here and there to be squirreled away for a future newsletter. Plus, the general workload has been pretty high so finding the time to read, compile and write is always difficult.</p>



<p>The newsletter is not gone, just on ice for 02025. It was taking way from <a href="https://optional.is/required/">publishing /required articles</a>, which is something we want to get back too.</p>



<p>The goal of the newsletter was to grow a readership that we could create a feedback loop for other ideas and projects. With newsletter fatigue and we didn&#8217;t want to be annoying and sound like a broken record (<em>Oh, by the way we have a newsletter</em>), means we didn&#8217;t grow our list as much as we&#8217;d hoped. Coupled with the fact that we didn&#8217;t want to make <strong>‚™Æ Good Morning</strong> feel like self-promotion means we painted ourselves a bit into the corner for cross-promotional activities in the company!</p>



<p>We&#8217;ll take everything we&#8217;ve learnt, save-up a bunch of links and be back with Season 4 of <strong>‚™Æ Good Morning</strong> soon.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>‚óç Quarternotes</strong></h3>



<p>Our quarterly newsletter isn&#8217;t going anywhere. We still use/need this, the readership is strong and it&#8217;s a great away to &#8220;keep the engines warm&#8221; to be able to contact people about future projects; be it an event, a crowdfunding idea, a new product or an ask for help.</p>



<p>This newsletter has fallen now into a nice format: What we&#8217;ve done, what we&#8217;ve written, something interesting, link to merch, open office hours and maybe something more.</p>



<p>Some of what <strong>‚™Æ Good Morning</strong> was, with interesting links, will get folded back into <strong>‚óç Quarternotes</strong>. Our goal is to stay relevant &amp; interesting and deliver some value to you for subscribing &amp; reading. There are a lot of folks we used to meet regularly at conferences and sometime we wonder &#8220;What are they doing now&#8221;? This newsletter is a way to answer that question others might be asking about us.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Subscribe</h2>



<p>If any of this is interesting, we highly recommend that you <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/">subscribe</a> in some fashion. Either sign-up and get our newsletters delivered to your inbox (it is easy to search, works offline, syncs across devices) or subscribe via the RSS feed (its anonymous, no spam filters) so you never miss an issue (that is until the AI bots ruin it). You can even read them online (if you remember to check), they are there for people to read back issues and to be picked-up by search indexes.</p>



<p>Using <a href="https://optional.is/feeds/">our RSS feeds</a>, it is possible to get our newsletters and articles side-by-side in your newsreader. We recently add feeds so that people can caught-up with us in the way they best see fit.</p>



<p>As long as you keep reading, we&#8217;ll keep writing.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[Our final double weeknote for 02024. Not an exiting two weeks, but lots of work got done.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #721</h2>



<p>This week we had a look at various services that we use and took a bit of an audit. We constantly get emails from Google about your monthly invoice, then open it and it is zero dollars. For various clients over the years we&#8217;ve created Google Maps API keys using our own email. It&#8217;s always been well under the free tier of their service so it&#8217;s never been an issue. In March 02025, Google is changing their billing tiers so it was time for us to go in and review everything. (What a car crash of a UI/UX to figure things out. When you need to promote your Gemini AI tool to help people navigate your own tool, maybe somethings wrong with your tool?)</p>



<p>We then did the same thing for Heroku. Turn down some services, parked others until they are needed again.</p>



<p>Finally, for another project we&#8217;ve been making extensive use of iCloud containers. They have a unique permission system in that there is Public, Shared and Private containers and users have inherited permissions. We changed a few things since we want a public database which can be read by everyone, but by default anyone can write to it, and update any records they created. To solve this, we turned off all but the read permissions and related a new permission role just for ourselves to manage the public database via a web admin tool.</p>



<p>For our tablet/VR project we continue to add content and fix bugs that come-up along the way. There is a soft deadline later this month, so we&#8217;re cleaning things-up and reviewing the system closer.</p>



<p>As the end of the year approaches, we started to stub a bunch of articles for the new year. There is a template of topics that we post in January. This week we started to gather the data and flush out the posts with some headings and links as necessary.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #722</h2>



<p>On Wednesday we had a day long meeting and planning session for our eBike. The group needed a good re-focusing and now we have some next steps for the next few months.</p>



<p>On Thursday we had a call with our Miami project. We&#8217;re mostly done with the day-to-day aspects of the coding, but we&#8217;re keeping one foot in their camp to help. We had a quick call to brainstorm some scaling issues, reporting tracking/metric ideas, MVP features and others. We might not have all the answers, but sometimes you just need to talk it out and get a second opinion and we&#8217;re happy to listen.</p>



<p>It has also been a week of content, content, content. Finishing-up as many todos as we can for review in the tablet/vr app. Things are in a good place: there is more content to come, but we know what&#8217;s missing and what&#8217;s left todo for next week.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Happy Holidays</h2>



<p>This will be the last weeknote we write before the end of the 02024. We have two small things left on our publishing schedule and we&#8217;re taking time off for the holidays. We have our December <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/">‚™Æ Good Morning Newsletter</a> to send and a final article for 02024 to publish.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A much overdue 11 week, weeknote. They are brief and we've had a few long running tasks which are settling into a rhythm now.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>This is a massive 11 week, weeknote. That covers nearly 3 months of workload. This is obviously a bad summary, but we&#8217;ve been swamped with tasks that all happened at the same time, therefore things like weeknotes and quarternotes got delayed. With the thanksgiving break in the US, we&#8217;re back on top of things and (hopefully) can stay on track a bit better.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #709</h2>



<p>This week, we got confirmation that our secrete NDA is a go! We obviously can&#8217;t talk about it, and possibly never be able too, but our portion is to help get the proposal finished for the deadline. We&#8217;ll have one sync with the company just to confirm we&#8217;re on the right track, then have more time for the final proposal. We were given a list of topics we could choose from and we need to pitch (atleast) 4 ideas in our presentation. This is a fun and interesting project, right in the middle of plenty of other deadlines!</p>



<p>In October, we start several surveys. Our continual student survey, but also a 2-5th grade survey and a high-school survey. There aren&#8217;t many changes to the questions, we are adding one about using AI for coursework, but we do have a bunch of service updates. </p>



<p>For the high school, we are adding Arabic to the list of translated languages. When we do that, we also need to update some HTML and CSS to handle the right-to-left direction of the text and images.</p>



<p>In Icelandic, we also added a pronoun switcher. When a school uploads their list of students, one of the columns is <code>sex</code>. This is used to have a breakdown in the results, but we are also keeping things anonymous. With the rise of a 3rd sex value, we are at risk of breaking anonymity. To help mitigate this, when you start a survey and agree to the informed consent, if you are not set with a sex value of 1 or 2 (see <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/81682.html">ISO/IEC 5218</a>) then we randomly assign you a value. But then throughout the rest of the survey, we might be declining your pronouns incorrectly. To solve this, we implemented a cookie-based pronoun switcher, we already do this for language, now we have another variable for the three Icelandic language genders (masculine, feminine and neutral).</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #710</h2>



<p>This week we sent out our <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/s03e09/">September ‚™Æ Good Morning Newsletter</a>. As with all our newsletters, you can subscribe to get it delivered to your inbox, or via <a href="https://optional.is/feeds/">RSS</a> or <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/">read the archives online</a>.</p>



<p>We pulled the plug on a project in Australia this week. The customer had a sales system and an inventory system and wanted to better connect the two. Sadly, one had an API, the other didn&#8217;t, and exporting CSVs from one and trying to write some import code to get that data into the other system was&#8217;t going to work unless we basically replicated the original system. We gave the client the news and stopped looking into this further.</p>



<p>The school survey work continues. Once things start, we are not doing much (if any) code, infrastructure or question updates. But we are still needed for all the &#8216;touch points&#8217;.  We send out emails, SMSes and robocalls to the participants and customers. Over the summer we transitioned away from 90s&#8217; style table-based HTML emails to a much simpler email template. So we had to keep a close eye on all those changes.</p>



<p>We got an official green light on a new AR/Tablet project! This is going to be fun and interesting. It is completely Apple focused, so we can deep dive on some of their technologies without having to worry about cross-platform compatibility. Hopefully, we can talk more about the project and all the hiccups we&#8217;ve run into along the way.</p>



<p>The project in Miami is deep in their fundraising phase. We&#8217;re transitioning away from tasks. Originally, we were helping them build out there software stack over the summer, but things always take a bit longer than expected.</p>



<p>The core of this week was focused on the NDA presentation. We needed to prep a deck for our first presentation. That meant getting a lot of meeting discussions out of peoples&#8217; heads and into text, sketches and renderings to show the customer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #711</h2>



<p>As if we didn&#8217;t have enough surveys ongoing, we added one more. This is about our eBike prototype. We think we know who our target market is and what they want, but it is now time to ask them what they really, really want. Obviously, the survey isn&#8217;t perfect. It is self-selecting and as we found out a few weeks later, we also took a bit of an &#8216;Icelandic&#8217; view and made a few assumptions which got called out.</p>



<p>For our the AR/tablet app, we spent some time working on the iPad app. We choose to develop this in SwiftUI, which means that we can include and overlap 99% of the code base for different platforms. With a few <code>#if os(iOS) ... #endif</code> macros we can control for any major differences. For instance, the Apple TV doesn&#8217;t have a camera, so Augmented Reality features are not available.</p>



<p>On Friday, we had our first feedback sync on our secrete NDA project.  It was both good and soul crushing. As with creative work, you put a bunch of time and effort into something and without any real explanation it gets shot-down before it has a chance. Some of our ideas didn&#8217;t make this first cut, but we did get some invaluable feedback which we&#8217;ll take away and work into the other ideas.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #712</h2>



<p>This week was sprinkled with AR/Tablet SwiftUI development and getting the final deck together for the final pitch next week.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, we meet an old friend for lunch and potential project plans. This is something we really want to keep warm so we can jump on the project at any moment, but it&#8217;s difficult to find the time and attention it deserves.</p>



<p>We have an old project which used the old Icelandic Single Sign-On service. We&#8217;re working with another software provider to transition away to another solution. They are already building a tool for our customer. The plan is to piggy-back that service. We had a meeting with the company this week, to plan how to make that handoff.</p>



<p>With the end of the month, we need to go through all the bills, salary payments and prep our VAT returns.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #713</h2>



<p>Our two new surveys are in full swing and we&#8217;re monitoring the progress along with the reminders schedules.</p>



<p>This week we continue further with our AR/Tablet app. We started out quick and dirty by including all the assets in the app. Once we got confirmation that this is the direction and we knew more about what was being presented, we took this week and moved it into data structures in an iCloud container. Now the app syncs with an online database and pulls assets from AWS&#8217; S3.</p>



<p>On Friday we had our final pitch for the secret NDA project. They were hard to read, but we think it went well. We&#8217;re still not 100% sure what this was for or if/when we might get any feedback or continue with the project? It might simply be an exercise that this company does to get outside feedback on ideas and learn about all the things they &#8220;don&#8217;t know they don&#8217;t know about&#8221;, those unknown, unknowns.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #714</h2>



<p>The AR/Tablet app is mostly an optimized image gallery viewer. Which means once the code was in place to view and manage the images, it was then about loading it with content! We decided (or it was decided for us) that the content couldn&#8217;t live in the app, but needed to be online and downloaded on launch. This week was spent adding more and more image content and tweaking the gallery views. As part of that process, we improved the web admin portion to crop and upload images, and connect them with content.</p>



<p>As part of our surveys, we send out SMSes and Robocalls. For the SMSes, we have a shortcode label so no phone number is required, but for the Robocalls, we call from a number we control, have vetted and have an explanatory voice mail message for those who call back. Strangely, when we went to test things failed and after some digging it was because we no longer had the number we rented from Twilio!</p>



<p>We&#8217;re not exactly sure how we lost it?! When we tried to reclaim it, or any number for that matter, we couldn&#8217;t for Iceland. After a bunch of support tickets and some forms and proof we&#8217;re a company, we did manage to get our old number back. We dug through the email archives and can&#8217;t find any correspondence about our number being cancelled or removed due to lack of payment? We suspect they dropped support for Iceland since not many were using it, and we fell through the cracks. After a stressful few days, we did manage to get back on track without needing to delay our robocall reminders.</p>



<p>Finally, this week we sent out the <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/s03e10/">October ‚™Æ Good Morning Newsletter</a>. As with all our newsletters, you can subscribe to get it delivered to your inbox, or via <a href="https://optional.is/feeds/">RSS</a> or <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/">read the archives online</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #715</h2>



<p>The survey reminders are all finished this week, and we hand over the task of getting a high-enough response rate over to the organization contacts. It is now their job to take the last two weeks to round-up everyone who hasn&#8217;t answered to get on it so the organization&#8217;s results will be released.</p>



<p>For the AR/Tablet project we&#8217;ve been deep in image content and continuing with app bug fixes and tweaks.</p>



<p>We had a meeting about an old project to try and get to get it started again. Internally, we&#8217;ve discussed A and B projects. A-projects are client lead, big, year-long projects that involve a lot of people. The B-projects are meant to fill some voids between when we finish out part and hand it over to a client who might take a week to respond. The smaller B-projects are meant to fill those voids, give a change from the monotony of A-project tasks, allow us to experiment and explore on our own and give junior team members more ownership in non-critical projects.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we can get this great little B-project started again.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #716</h2>



<p>It is the end of the month, so surveys closed. Since we spin-up a unique instance of each data collection server on heroku for each survey type, we have the small tasks of exporting the results, clearing any personal information and turning down the dynos to minimize the costs while no one is using the servers for another 10 months.</p>



<p>We also closed the eBike survey and will take some time next week to analyze the results for the team.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #717</h2>



<p>With the old Miami we ran into a few bugs with the US Daylight savings change. They say in computer science, one of the hardest problems is timezones, and they are right! We were smart and saved everything in UTC in the database, but depending on the day an entry was created and when the entry would take place, there could be a shift in the actual time.</p>



<p>The AR/Tablet app portion is in a good place, so it is time to loop back and improve some Quality of Life issues with the backend web service. Since the database is an iCloud container, it is all key-value pairs instead of a typical mySQL/Postgres relational database. Luckily Apple allows server-to-server communications, so we&#8217;ve written some basic PHP code to be able to CrUD (Create, Update and Delete) data. That&#8217;s worked for a few weeks now, but adding in canvas image cropping and uploading, and better connecting the different models together to make it easier to navigate around. Just simple things like after you create an object, you get the UUID and then go to the detail or parent page rather than dumping back to a big list. We&#8217;re quiet happy with how it is progressing, but certainly not ready for the client to use it yet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #718</h2>



<p>As part of &#8220;just getting things done&#8221; we used AWS&#8217; S3 to store all the images, thumbnails and media. Luckily, the app just reads and caches the information at the end of a URL, so moving somewhere else wasn&#8217;t an issue. Our client is a Microsoft shop and they are probably already paying some service contract with Microsoft, so it was this week&#8217;s task to move from S3 to Azure blobs!</p>



<p>It took some time to get a client-side javascript image uploader working, but we managed. After downloading all the existing data and re-uploading it to Azure, we wrote a small script to find and replace the old URLs with the new ones (the file names were always an md5 hash to avoid collisions) and the app just needed to re-cache the data and we&#8217;re back to normal &#8211; no hiccups.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #719</h2>



<p>This week we sent out our <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/s03e11/">November ‚™Æ Good Morning newsletter</a> and our (very late) <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/02024Q4/">02024Q4 Quarternotes Newsletter</a>. You can subscribe to get them delivered to your inbox, or via <a href="https://optional.is/feeds/">RSS</a>, or you can read them and all the <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/">archives online</a>.</p>



<p>The eBike team met-up online and reviewed the survey results and some next steps for the prototype. We keep expanding the team pulling more experts in various categories. We are planning a meeting early December to all meet in person and invite a few more folks who&#8217;ve helped to have a look at the prototype and give some feedback.</p>



<p>One of our Australian projects is getting a small update. The plumbing company we built a time tracking to XERO web app has changed its structure, and (probably) for legal reasons is setting-up a new XERO account under the new company&#8217;s ID. We duplicated our Django application and setup a new heroku service. In the process we updated software versions, cleaned-up a few basic things and updated the UUID references to where Tracking Categories, Wages and other payroll related line items in our code. The plan is to make the switch-over in the new year, but we&#8217;re getting it all ready so they can import staff and jobs to test before the deadlines.</p>



<p>We had a great, long overdue catch-up with an old friend. We talked stereoscopic photography for a good hour or more. Lots of ideas and tests (both hardware and software). We&#8217;re looking forward to more experiments.</p>



<p>Since the October surveys are closed and results calculated and sent to the customers, it is on to prepping for the spring surveys. We ask our customers for an upload (excel or csv) of the students/employees/parents that will be asked to take the survey. We originally structured our importer based on what was easy for them to export from some of the more popular tools. Recently, a new software tool to track students has come to the market and instead of exporting 1 row per student, it exports 1 row per guardian (with some student info). That means we need to do some merging to convert it from a long to a wide list. This week we spent some time updating our importing code to try the original way and if the columns don&#8217;t match fall back and try this new format, massage the data to what we want and continue it through our pipeline. It works, now we need to test all those edge cases and consequence of these choices.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #720</h2>



<p>In the US it is Thanksgiving on Thursday. The office for US project was closed this week, so that meant we have some extra time to get back on track. That included the internal stuff like: working out insurance for 02025, writing these weeknotes, stubbing drafts for the start of next year, doing VAT paperwork and more. But in-between, we also managed to start on a <a href="http://blender.org">Blender software</a> tutorial.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/donuts2.jpg" alt="Two 3D rendered doughnuts"/>
<figcaption>Using Blender 3D software, we created two demo tutorial doughnuts</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>The goal is to work more on 3D AR Objects, but todo that you gotta be able to create and edit them. Blender is a beast in of itself, but having to export to USD format is yet another pain and learning curve. With some help from Reality Converter and Reality Composer Pro, we&#8217;ve gotten a few more tests and samples working. We&#8217;re happy with this little week long experiment and can get back to regularly schedule tasks next week.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Up Next</h2>



<p>Realistically, we have four more weeks until the new year and the last two of those are going to be a lot of holiday downtime. So we&#8217;ll get 1 more double weeknote out, and start all the new year template posts (<a href="https://optional.is/required/category/omnibus/">Omnibus</a>, <a href="https://optional.is/required/category/annual-report/">Annual Report</a>, <a href="https://optional.is/required/tag/til/">This Year I Learnt</a>) and prepping a bit for Q1 Quarternotes.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A double weeknote as we ramp-up after the summer break.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #707</h2>



<p>As one project wanes another waxes. The amount of time we&#8217;ve been spending on the Miami project has decreased. They&#8217;re in good shape; onboarding customers and prepping for raising a round of investment. The features, bugs and tasks are at a minimum as they want to be stable and get customer feedback. Which means we have more time for some VR projects. The video team has handed over the rough spatial videos and we&#8217;ve been putting them into an app for review. Then our client has the opportunity to look at the footage in an Apple Vision Pro and approve which clips they want to clean-up further. (By cleaning-up this means removing any tripods, drone rotors, color grading, blending two different shots for indoor and outdoor lighting, etc.)</p>



<p>A very old, pre-COVID project is coming out of mothballs. We worked on a health survey starting back in 02018 (or maybe even earlier?). It was making use of Iceland&#8217;s single-sign-on service. Now that is closed, they are working with another company on au√∞kenni login. We got dragged along to help get that working with the health survey. We&#8217;re recommending to use the other company and remove us from the development loop altogether. We are happy to continue to consult on data and visualizations, but we don&#8217;t have the time for new development or maintenance.</p>



<p>With the end of the Single Sign-on Service (island.is), our other survey tools have moved to TOTP (time-based One-Time Passwords). These are the additional 6 digits you enter from your authenticator app when you login. We rolled this out at the start of the summer and have our customers several months to migrate over before we made it mandatory. We&#8217;ve also been taking things in steps. At the start of the summer you could always login without 2FA, but you would not see any results until you enabled it. Next week, we&#8217;ll turn this on for everyone who needs manage surveys, not just see results. At this point, all sensitive data will be behind 2FA.</p>



<p>Our mastodon instance is back up and running. You can follow some of the team here: <a href="https://lodfill.is/@briansuda">https://lodfill.is/@briansuda</a></p>



<p>We&#8217;re waiting for an NDA for a big new project, or we think it&#8217;s big, they can&#8217;t tell us much until we sign, and after we do, we can&#8217;t talk about it. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f937-1f3fb-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p>We&#8217;re also waiting for another big contract to be signed before we potentially get pulled into more work. This is via another team that we&#8217;ve done some analytics stuff in the past with, but this new project might not need a lot of data work, but we&#8217;re on call if needed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #708</h2>



<p>Monday started with a <a href="https://petals.team">PETALS</a> sync. There are two upcoming events where PETALS is being discussed, so today we went over loose-ends, the staging server and tasks for the next 3 weeks. </p>



<p>Monday is also Labor Day in the USA, so it is quiet &#8211; no meetings, no project movement.</p>



<p>Our Student Surveys also started today, Monday September 1st. They run for 9 months, so this is our longest running survey. We do update the survey with big fixes through out the year, but we do our best to free development as to not break anything or make any big changes mid-survey. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f389.png" alt="üéâ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/hex-maze-1024x767.png" alt="Hex Maze" />
<figcaption>Dynamically generated maze using a grid of hexagons.</figcaption>
</figure>



<p>We continue to explore more generative mazes for our <a href="https://adventure-mazes.com">Adventure Mazes Books</a>. This time we tried to generate mazes using hexagons instead of squares. In a normal square gird maze, from any spot you have 4 potential directions the maze could branch, but with hexagons, you have 6 ways it could branch. You&#8217;d think this additional paths would create for a harder maze, but given you don&#8217;t want to be able to loop back into the main path to the exit, we feel it makes things easier to solve? Some testing will help.</p>



<p>Miami is back to the forefront getting invoicing and rates included into the backend logic. Each customer can set various contracts in place with their clients. When the job is done, we created a scheduled task to roll-up on an hourly, weekly, fortnightly or monthly basis all the jobs and the total costs to create an invoice.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re getting back some sample Spatial Videos to preview in the VR headsets. We&#8217;re getting that workflow in place for client review. The way you shoot and compose videos and stories for an immersive experience is completely different than you do for a flat screen. It&#8217;s been a great learning experience.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re STILL waiting for an NDA for a big new project, or we think it&#8217;s big, they can&#8217;t tell us much until we sign, and after we do, we can&#8217;t talk about it. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f937-1f3fb-200d-2642-fe0f.png" alt="ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

					<description><![CDATA[A triple weekenote where we get back into the office and are getting caught-up with projects. Usually summer is slow, but this year it has been non-stop!]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #704</h2>



<p>Monday was a public holiday in Iceland, it was Commerce Day&nbsp;or Verslumannahelgi. It is a big travel weekend and bookends the summer holidays.</p>



<p>Wednesday we got back to the Reykjavik Office and are slowly getting things back in order.</p>



<p>We got caught-up on <a href="https://adventure-mazes.com">Adventure Mazes</a> publishing tasks. We&#8217;ve been updating the PDFs slightly and tweaked the logo. There is a digital download if you want to print it yourself. The website is mostly made-up of horizontal block banners. We kept it simple so it also works on mobile. Since each block works more-or-less independently, we also have a tiny PHP if statement to rearrange them based on the date. That means as Halloween approaches, that block is at the top. In November the Christmas mazes are featured. As we add more books, we can continue to dynamically re-order topics based on the time of year.</p>



<p>We use Heroku for most projects. It is easy to work with and simple to turn over to a customer without them needing a dedicated IT team to manage it all. As part of that process, Heroku is pretty good about keeping minor versions of software up-to-date, but every once and awhile we need to go in and manually back-up and update bigger version jumps for the database, python or the Heroku stack. We took advantage of the slow summer days and made some improvements.</p>



<p>On Friday, we had a <a href="https://petals.team">PETALS</a> sync meeting. After the long summer, we&#8217;re getting back on track by reviewing tasks, updating the priorities and generally getting back into a rhythm.</p>



<p>The Miami Project continues to move forward. We started to connect Stripe so that in the future we can collect payments. It is still too early to figure out pricing, but we&#8217;ve built it into the app and the backend so it is ready to turn on at any time. The other important thing that needed to be built to make this happen is to make sure the app won&#8217;t work unless the customer upgrades. Otherwise, you can roll-out a payment scheme, but if a customer doesn&#8217;t update, they never see the payment button! Otherwise, most of our tasks are not Quality-of-Life type of improvements: Better mobile views on the website, more SMS and push notifications, referral program and other small things.</p>



<p>The VR Project is now back to the front of the queue. We&#8217;ve taken the SwiftUI code for the Vision Pro and ported it over to the iPad. Most everything works fine, but we need to change some colors; the Vision Pro is a default dark/glass theme and the iPad is white. The other team making content is finished and next week we&#8217;ll start to get raw images and video we can plug into flush out the UI a bit more.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #705</h2>



<p>This week we learnt about <a href="https://www.designswarm.com/papercamp-3/">PaperCamp 3</a>! It is a little over a month away in London and we&#8217;re seriously contemplating going. 10+ years ago, we were invited to PaperCamp 1 (or 2) and missed it and have forever regretted it. That saw the seeds of &#8220;Little Printer&#8221; be born &#8211; which we still think is a great idea!</p>



<p>On Wednesday we had a meeting about the depreciation of the Island.is SSO (Single Sign-On). We used this on several projects so we&#8217;ve been aware of the End-of-Life deadline for awhile. On projects which did NOT need strong user-authentication, we&#8217;ve moved to 2FA using a TOTP (Time-based One Time Password). But we have one project that needed the strong authentication. This meeting was the first to figure out how best to deal with it going forward.</p>



<p>We fell behind on our <strong>‚™Æ Good Morning</strong> newsletter due to travel and work, but we&#8217;ll do our best to get 4 interesting links out for August.</p>



<p>We have some raw 180¬∞ spatial videos to test in a Vision Pro. So the VR Project is now in full swing! This is exciting and certainly will lead to more projects. The goal here is to make a prototype app and workflow. They customer wants to be able to replicate the workflow for several of their projects, but since no one&#8217;s done this before, we&#8217;re also learning what works, what doesn&#8217;t, what&#8217;s feasible and what has the &#8216;wow&#8217; factor. Then we can better harden the app to make the updates dynamic and improve the workflow for future projects.</p>



<p>Now that we&#8217;re a good 8 months into the year, we spent some time re-evaluating our hourly work-load on some projects and looking into our rent contract. Taking an average of expenses for just 1-2 months can miss a bunch of annual payments, but using the last 8 month (or even 20 if we include last year) gives us a better average monthly spend. Taking all these numbers, we&#8217;re looking to update our rates and workload in the fall and going into 02025.</p>



<p>The old adage about where to complain about Twitter when Twitter was down now applied to Mastodon! Our local instance is down. There were less than 100 people using it and even less active. I&#8217;m not sure if the owner is away or even aware, but it&#8217;s been a week and it isn&#8217;t back up. We partly don&#8217;t care, but it would be great to know if it is coming back-up so we can either continue or migrate our data somewhere else. Certainly a LOW priority these days.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #706</h2>



<p>We continue with the Miami project as it is slowing down for us. The remaining tasks are not as urgent and are cleaning-up and making the general experience better.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been getting back into Swift Programming. We had two goals this week: one was to get some Bonjour networking messages passed between two different devices and the second was working with some 3D models as navigation elements.</p>



<p>On Friday, we sent out <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/s03e08/">Season 3, Episode 8 of our ‚™Æ Good Morning newsletter</a>. It was a bit behind scheduled, but better late than never!</p>



<p>We also had our <a href="https://petals.team" data-type="link" data-id="petals.team">PETALS</a> sync where we went over tasks and reviewed the project status.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A double weeknote from the East of Iceland.]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #702</h2>



<p>On Monday, <a href="https://lodfill.is/@briansuda/112830920744430631">we posted on social media some Puffin pictures</a> taken in Borgarfj√∂r√∞ur eystri. The post continued to get boosts for several days. The photos were taken with the <a href="https://hipstamatic.app/app/tintype">TinType app</a>, and two experimental apps we&#8217;ve been working on. The first is a series of filters, one attempts to emulate the <a href="https://www.lomography.com">LOMO camera look</a>. The other app was inspired by <a href="https://xavibou.com/ornithographies/">Xavi Bou&#8217;s ornithographies</a>. This app takes the video feed frames and flattens them using the &#8216;darken&#8217; blend mode. It creates these timelapses in a single image.</p>



<figure class="banner"><a href="https://lodfill.is/@briansuda/112830920744430631"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mastodon-1024x927.png" alt="Screenshot of the Mastodon post" /></a></figure>



<p>On Wednesday, we sent out our <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/s03e07/">seventh episode of the ‚™Æ Good Morning Newsletter</a>. You can read it <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/">online</a>, in your <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/subscribe/">inbox</a> or via <a href="https://optional.is/feeds/">RSS</a>. We send out monthly newsletters on various, interesting topics.</p>



<p>We continue to update the <a href="https://adventure-mazes.com">Adventure Maze</a> print-on-demand books. We moved from a themed amount of pages (24 pages for Christmas and 31 for Halloween) to just a simple 100 mazes per book. In doing so, we needed to re-setup all the entries on Amazon along with update the cover now that the spine has more pages along with the actual content. We&#8217;re not 100% done with all three books and they are available for sale! Next step, digital versions.</p>



<p>Since we moved office to Egilssta√∞ir, the place we&#8217;re staying doesn&#8217;t (or we can&#8217;t find) any dice. One app we&#8217;ve had on the back burner for awhile was an iMessages Dice Rolling app. It got bogged down in a lot of internal design decisions and has been stuck. Ignoring all that, we made a quick SwuiftUI dice roller for ourselves. There are probably plenty of web-based and app based dice rollers already, but as they say, there are also plenty of love songs and people still continue to write them!</p>



<p>Making our own Dice Roller app was a great little exercise. It is useful and a great example, tutorial project for anyone who wants to learn SwiftUI.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #703</h2>



<p><a href="https://briansuda.gumroad.com/l/am-bundle">The Adventure Mazes now have a Digital Bundle version</a>. We&#8217;re still experimenting with pricing, but for $9 (the price of one book) you get PDFs of all three books. We have additional book ideas in the pipeline, so the bundles will get updated accordingly. The effort is low to sell digital versions, so we thought we&#8217;d try and learn more in the process.</p>



<p>We made some stickers last week that finally arrived. They are a secret, so we can post any pictures (yet). Normally we used StickerMule for these sorts of projects. In the past the quality has been great and if you are not in a rush, they have weekly deals which are a fraction of the normal price. But recently, their CEO went and used the marketing mailing list to spam everyone about Trump.</p>



<p>Our Miami work continues. All the major backend tasks are wrapping-up and we&#8217;re going to be switching gears next week, but not sure to exactly what.</p>



<p>The big VR project continues to tick along. We&#8217;ve ported most of the code over to an iPad app and are now iterating with the client&#8217;s feedback on layout and content containers as the content is being produced.</p>



<p>We also got back into some analytics number crunching. We recently released some new features in an app and needed to keep an eye on the general performance. One of our partners also needed some numbers about how various characters were performing in game, so we had to dig-up both how many games they were choose, but the number of player who have unlocked those characters so we could normalize the data into some popularity ranking.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[A double weeknote. The workload is high and we're changing offices to the other side of the country for a few weeks.
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #700</h2>



<p>On Monday, we had our Friday <a href="https://petals.team">PETALS</a> meet-up. We went over each of the screens. The goal is to clean-up some of the text and design, use the data to focus the story and general clean-up and bug fixes. The next few weeks are gong to be slow with PETALS, but it&#8217;s good to always have a backlog of small tasks when things are slow.</p>



<p>Miami Project is rumbling along. Bug fixes, feature requests and UI tweaks all coming in this week as they get more feedback from real customers.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been working on our <a href="https://adventure-mazes.com">Adventure Mazes</a> again. After a lot of feedback, we&#8217;ve realized that we needed to increase our page count in the books. Since all the mazes are generated in code, it was easy create a 100 page adventure maze book. A few minutes here and a few minutes there, we&#8217;ve been solving each maze just to confirm it is possible and made some small editorial changes to make it more fun. We want to prep this for the holiday season(s) and start to work on digital versions for download and print at home.</p>



<p>Another game proposal and prototype we made is moving to the next stage of its life-cycle. The feedback was well received and now we&#8217;re shifting some resources around to re-build it in Unity to see how far we can get easily.</p>



<p>We&#8217;ve been trying (and failing) to pry back some time for another VR project. We&#8217;re still in good shape because most of the content is not available yet, but it will be in a few weeks and everyone&#8217;s going to want to see some progress!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Week #701</h2>



<p>On Monday, we relocated the office to the other side of the country to Egilssta√∞ir for a few weeks. It will be a nice change of scenery and allow us to get a break from office construction. It is a long trip, but there are plenty of amazing scenery along the way.</p>



<figure class="banner"><img decoding="async" src="https://optional.is/required/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/iceland-collage.jpg" alt="Collage of photos from around Iceland" /></figure>



<p>This month was the start of the 3rd quarter, which means we sent out our <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/02024Q3/">Q3 quarternotes newsletter</a>. You can always subscribe via email and RSS, or just read the archives online at <a href="https://optional.is/newsletter/">optional.is/newsletter/</a></p>



<p>The Miami project continues to rumble along. Every day, we make progress. It is in those exciting days of building something new for a customer, getting feedback and iterating on a daily basis. We&#8217;re not stuck in arguing about what feature to build or how to eke out 1% more performance from onboarding or how to increase D30 retention.</p>



<p>We&#8217;re getting back on track with our VR projects. Next week, there is a videography team going on location to record some video and photos for us to use on the VR headsets and tablet devices. We&#8217;ve been prepping most of app work with demo photos and videos, but it will be great to start to swap it out with real content.</p>



<p>Internally, we&#8217;ve been working on revamping some of our print-on-demand projects for Q4. We&#8217;ve tried to make it more digestible. If we can break it down into small enough tasks, there is hope we can get through all of them. Step 1: Take our three books and generate the additional content. <strong>3/3 Done</strong>. Step 2: Review that content and make adjustments. <strong>2/3 Done</strong>. Step 3: Merge those changes back into the source PDF. <strong>2/3 Done</strong>. Step 4: Re-publish the books on Amazon. <strong>2/3 Done</strong>. The final (optional) step is to update the logo. It was originally hand-drawn and is not balanced and was obviously done by someone right-handed. Step 1: Mathematically map out the design and redraw. <strong>Done.</strong> Step 2: Digitize to vectors. <strong>10% Done?</strong> Step 3: Update all instances of it. This is going to be a long process as we&#8217;ll continue to find it in places for a while.</p>
