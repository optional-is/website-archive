				<p>It is week #178 and it is summertime. This week share&#8217;s its name with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/178_Belisana">178 Belisana</a>, a large main belt asteroid. Discovered in late 01877, this asteroid is named after the Celtic goddess, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belisama">Belisama</a>, rather than the more usual Greek or Roman. This week also share&#8217;s its name with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/178P/Hug-Bell">178P/Hug-Bell</a> a periodic comet that orbits every seven years. What makes this comet special is that it is thought to be the first discovered by amateurs.</p>
<p>Our week 178 didn&#8217;t see anything as interesting as a comet. With summer here, things are certainly slow, so we&#8217;ve been catching-up on a few proposals, research documents, emails and a backlog of links to read and watch. Several people take these &#8220;Think Weeks&#8221; to get through their backlog of reading. Doing so all at once helps to make the connections between some of the topics you might have just read. While this week hasn&#8217;t been that intense, it has sparked a few ideas.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been working on <a href="../../../../../newsletter/index.html">improving our quarterly newsletter</a>, which will go out shortly after the World Cup is over. You can sign-up anytime. It is a low volume, interesting newsletter we publish four times a year.</p>
<p>Some of our time this week has been spent creating some static file services for the mosfell project. We also picked-up a few hundred more customs and toll stickers which we filled out and stuck on all the envelops for the Analog.is Kickstarter rewards.</p>
<p>There is also another project or two in the brainstorming phase. As always, we&#8217;re on the look out for things that are quintessentially Icelandic. On our last trip through the Netherlands, the KLM flight had plastic cups with a wooden shoe, a windmill, a bike and other iconic Dutch objects. Thinking about what the Icelandic equivalents would be isn&#8217;t as easy. Nature, northern lights and waterfalls all come to mind, but are hard to iconographize onto a plastic cup easily. So we&#8217;re always on the look out. One such very Nordic tradition is that of the woolen sweaters and cross-stitch. We have a book full of these primitive pixel art designs and have been using and adapting them accordingly.</p>
<div class="banner"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/07/patterns.png" alt="patterns" width="700" height="135" /></div>
<p>Experimenting with these designs, we can find use for some of them in subtle tiled backgrounds, wrapping paper or other uses entirely. We&#8217;re planning on having some of the better designs sent-off next week for some laser-cutting treatment. This is our first test to find the right materials and how the designs hold-up at various thicknesses and colors.</p>
<p>Now we are on the search for some very specific light bulbs, the kind that only have 1 filament. We are running into problems with other bulbs with multiple filaments or LEDs producing multiple sources of  light creating multiple shadows.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: inherit; color: #000000;">Bric-à-brac</h2>
<p>It seems that everything old is new again. We&#8217;ve been seeing a few designs recently focusing on stone age tools. Last March in an exhibition in Reykjavik, someone (who&#8217;s name we really should have written down) recreated several stone age tools in colorful ceramic.</p>
<div class="banner"><img src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/07/ceramic-stone-age.jpg" alt="ceramic-stone-age" width="700" height="1034" /></div>
<p>The more recently, <a href="http://www.amidov.com/" target="_blank">Dov Ganchrow</a> 3D printing handles and grips for stone aged tools. It is an interesting look at the low-tech tools and the high-tech 3D printing and scanning technology that we use today.</p>
