<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>02024 Daily News</strong></h2>



<p>This is the third year we&#8217;ve collected headlines daily. The original idea behind this was that news stories don&#8217;t last a day, but we ready them in a serialized daily format. We wanted a way to look at trends and breadth of a story. These headlines are completely biased to both personal tastes, presumed historic value and news corporations publication interest. </p>



<p>Every year a new smart phone is released, that&#8217;s less &#8220;news&#8221; and more of a &#8220;press release&#8221;. We are looking for headlines that might take days, weeks or years to play out. That’s not to say there aren’t some one-off headlines and add value in seeing them in context.</p>



<p><a href="../../../../2023/01/10/02022-til/index.html">02022 TIL</a> and <a href="../../../../2024/01/23/02023-til/index.html">02023 TIL</a> are also worth skimming over since a news story doesn&#8217;t always stop and start in a day. Some take weeks, or even years to develop.</p>



<p>This is a list of “This Year I Learnt” headlines from various news sources and hashtags we added. Some of the events listed might have happened the day before the news broke or due to timezone, some events might have occurred in the future in relation to the local news website’s geographic location.</p>



<p>These headlines are (mostly) verbatim from the website. We didn’t write them, but saved the exact text to make it easier to copy and paste into any search engine and find the original. There are different spellings for various people and places – that’s not out typo, that’s different news organization style guides. After three year’s worth of headlines, we should have also saved the original link for the citation. &#x1f937;&#x1f3fb;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;</p>



<p><a href="index.html#headline-stats">At the end of the list, we’ve complied a stats list with a general overview</a>.</p>

<p>We added #hashtags to some of the headlines to help us aggregate some data. These are arbitrary as well and a single #tag might cover a much larger topic. For instance #ukraine is used for headlines related to Ukraine, but also the Russian invasion.</p>



<p>When we compare some of our categories to <a href="../../../../2024/01/23/02023-til/index.html">TIL 02023</a>, some are roughly consistent, like #obituaries and #space, but others are not! This year seems to be very #politics heavy. We also tried to include news in more countries, keeping an eye on Africa and South America as well. Others are fads, #crypto is down and #ai is up!</p>



<p>This is the third year we&#8217;ve done this and like previous years, we should have saved the source link as well. We have plans for something todo with the data, but haven&#8217;t had the time to build the tools. There’s always next year.</p>



<p>There are certainly were some major news stories we missed, others we got the outcome, but maybe not the seeds. This is a biased collection and will always have flaws, but we do our best to keep it interesting and look for over-arching trends that might take weeks or months to come to fruition. Things that regular media might gloss-over, but seeing them in a year-long context might give us a different perspective.</p>



<p>We’re open for feedback from this long list and adjust for 02025. We’ve found it interesting to read back over the news and see what our past-selves thought was interesting.</p>
