<p>Much like <a href="../../../../2023/01/10/02022-til/index.html">02022 TIL</a>, throughout 02023, each day we’d look at a few news websites and grab a few interesting headlines and paste them into a text file. These headlines are completely biased to both personal tastes, presumed historic value and news corporations publication interest. That’s not to say there aren’t some interesting entries and value in seeing things in context with each other.</p>



<p>This is the complete list of “This Year I Learnt” headlines from various news sources and some hashtags we added. Some of the events listed might have happened the day before the news broke or due to timezone, some events might have occurred in the future in relation to the local news website’s geographic location.</p>



<p>These are (mostly) direct copies of the headlines from the website. We didn’t write them, but instead used them verbatim to make it easier to copy and paste into any search engine and find them. There are also different spellings for various people and places – that’s not out typo, that’s different news organization style guides. After a year’s worth of headlines, we should have also saved the original link for the citation. &#x1f937;&#x1f3fb;&#x200d;&#x2642;&#xfe0f;</p>



<p><a href="index.html#headline-stats">At the end of the list, we’ve complied a stats list with a general overview</a>.</p>

<h2 id="headline-stats">Headline Stats</h2>



<p>In 02023, we collected 754 headlines from the following three major websites: <a href="https://www.bbc.com">BBC</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/international">Guardian</a>, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com">CNN</a> and a few from various social media links. We always intend to widen our collection net, so if you have any good suggestions for English newspapers covering other parts of spaceship Earth besides North America and Europe, please make some recommendations.</p>



<p>When we breakdown all the headlines and try to add some tags to them, we get the following overview.</p>



<table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Count</th><th>Percentage</th><th>Notes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="item">#ukraine</td><td>128</td><td>22.9%</td><td class="item">Relating to the Russian Invasion of Ukraine</td></tr><tr><td class="item">#politics</td><td>68</td><td>12.2%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="item">#obituary</td><td>61</td><td>10.9%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="item">#weather</td><td>43</td><td>7.7%</td><td class="item">Climate and weather related headlines</td></tr><tr><td class="item">#israel</td><td>42</td><td>7.5%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="item">#US</td><td>42</td><td>7.5%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="item">#UK</td><td>39</td><td>7.0%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="item">#china</td><td>25</td><td>4.5%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="item">#space</td><td>25</td><td>4.5%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="item">#türkiye</td><td>17</td><td>3.0%</td><td class="item">Turkey renamed itself to Türkiye, but the media hasn&#8217;t caught on</td></tr><tr><td class="item">#sports</td><td>16</td><td>2.9%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="item">#AUS</td><td>12</td><td>2.2%</td><td class="item">Headlines about Australia</td></tr><tr><td class="item">#italy</td><td>11</td><td>2.0%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="item">#brazil</td><td>10</td><td>1.8%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="item">#titanic</td><td>6</td><td>1.0%</td><td class="item">Headlines about the OceanGate submarine implosion</td></tr><tr><td class="item">#crypto</td><td>5</td><td>0.9%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="item">#spain</td><td>4</td><td>0.7%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="item">#AI</td><td>3</td><td>0.5%</td><td></td></tr><tr><td class="item">#open</td><td>1</td><td>0.2%</td><td class="item">Headlines about Open Source</td></tr></tbody></table>



<p>What we manage to collect is just as arbitrary as how we decided to tag each headline. Some topics might seem to overlap too much, some might be mis-aligned. #Israel for instance had several major headlines this year, but the underlying topics are very different (or maybe not?).</p>



<p>This is the second year we&#8217;ve done this and each year we regret not saving the source link. We also had high-hopes for a project we could easily build using this data to potentially create some interesting rabbit holes, but alas, time ran out on us to get it done by the end of the year. There&#8217;s always next year.</p>



<p>There certainly were some major news stories we probably missed, others we got the outcome, but maybe not the seeds. This is a biased collection and will always have flaws, but we do our best to keep it interesting and look for over-arching trends that might take weeks or months to come to fruition. Things that regular media might gloss-over, but seeing them in a year-long context might give us a different perspective.</p>



<p>We’re open for feedback from this long list and adjust for 02024. We’ve found it interesting to read back over the news and see what our past-selves thought was interesting.</p>
